T1  - Are women more afraid than men? Fear of recurrence in couples with cancer – predictors and sex-role-specific differences
AN  - 2472035831
AB  - PurposeAlthough fear of cancer recurrence (FoR) is one of the major concerns in cancer patients and their partners with approximately 49% reporting moderate to high FoR, few studies investigated predictors and sex-role-specific differences. The aim of the current study was to investigate FoR in couples with different types of cancer and to gain a deeper understanding of sex and role-specific differences and predictors of FoR in patients and partners.DesignCross-sectional study in Germany.Sample:N = 188 couples with prostate (PC; n=52), laryngeal (LC; n=21) or breast cancer (BC; n=115) participated. All PC and LC patients were males, all BC patients were females.MethodsFear of recurrence, depression, and relationship satisfaction were measured with validated questionnaires (Fear of Progression Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Quality of Marriage Index) in couples with PC, LC, or BC.FindingsResults indicated sex-role-specific differences. For women, FoR was higher for patients (M = 35.76) than for caregivers (M = 27.11). For males, spouses of women with BC (M = 30.1) showed higher FoR than male PC or LC patients (M = 24.9). Moreover, in couples there was a correlation between the FoR of one and the other (PC: r = .51, BC: r = .31, LC: r = .41). Depression was as a significant predictor, with a positive relationship to FoR. Moreover, in men with PC and LC besides depression, age emerged as significant predictor with a negative relationship to FoR. The Actor-Partner-Interdependence-Model showed for couples with PC or LC significant actor effects, both for patients and partners. Moreover, a significant partner effect emerged for patients’ depression on partners’ FoR. For couples with BC only significant actor effects occurred.ConclusionsFoR remains a major concern for both cancer patients and their partners.Implications for Psychosocial Providers or Policy: FoR should be considered both in cancer patients and their spouses. In addition, sex and role effects should be taken into account in treatment of FoR.

T1  - Oncology provider and African-American breast cancer survivor perceptions of the emotional experience of transitioning to survivorship
AN  - 2472035575
AB  - Purpose To examine the emotional experience of African American breast cancer survivors (BCS), and the information exchange between providers and patients, during transitioning to post-treatment survivorshipResearch Approach We conducted a qualitative study using interviews and focus groups.Participants We sought perspectives of oncology providers (n = 27) and African-American breast cancer survivors (BCS) (n = 45) who provided and received care in three counties in Washington State.Methods African-American community consultants conducted interviews and focus groups. Thematic coding and constant comparison were applied to identify emergent themes.Findings Participants reported emotional health information and support were needed but not consistently provided, resulting in a sense of survivor isolation. Systemic challenges limited providers’ ability to deliver emotional support information. Survivors and providers expressed similar understandings of the emotional impact of transition, but each group highlighted different, yet complementary priorities to address emotional needs of African-American BCS.Conclusions There is congruence between African-American BCS and oncology providers perceptions of the emotional experience of transitioning to post-treatment survivorship, but patients are not receiving adequate information and resources to help them adequately address their emotional needs.Implications for Policy Improved care continuity, team-based approaches, and partnerships between health systems and community organization partnerships may help patients and providers recognize and address emotional needs during the transition.

T1  - A pilot feasibility study of a group-delivered cancer parenting program: Enhancing Connections-Group
AN  - 2472035574
AB  - Objective The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and short-term impact of a 5-session fully manualized, group-delivered cancer parenting education program to diagnosed parents or surrogate parents with a school-age child.Design Single group, pre-post-test design with intent to treat analysis.Sample A total of 16 parents completed the program who were diagnosed within 12 months with non-metastatic cancer of any type (Stages 0-III), read and wrote English, had a child 5-17 years old who knew the parent’s diagnosis.Methods Assessments occurred at baseline and at 2 months post-baseline on standardized measures of parental depressed mood, anxiety, parenting self-efficacy, parenting quality, parenting skills and child behavioral-emotional adjustment.Findings/Results The program was feasible and well accepted: 16/18 (89%) of the enrolled participants were included in the intent to treat analysis. Program staff were consistently positive and enthusiastic about the demonstrated skills they observed in group attendees during the group-delivered sessions, including the emergence of support between attendees. Outcomes on all measures improved between baseline and post-intervention; changes were statistically significant on measures of parents’ anxiety, parents’ self-efficacy, parents’ skills, and parenting quality.Conclusions The group-delivered Enhancing Connections cancer parenting program has potential to improve behavioral-emotional outcomes on standardized measures of skills and emotional adjustment in parents, parent-surrogates and children. Future testing is warranted.Implications for Psychosocial Providers After a brief training, a fully manualized cancer parenting program can enhance parenting competencies and parent-reported child outcomes.

T1  - Living with the financial consequences of cancer: A life course perspective
AN  - 2472035522
AB  - Purpose Financial hardship can be a major cause of distress among persons with cancer, resulting in chronic stress and impacting physical and emotional health. This paper provides an analysis of the lived experience of cancer patients’ financial hardship from diagnosis to post-treatment.Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with 26 cancer survivors who reported financial hardship during and/or after treatment. The interviews were analyzed using DedooseTM as an organizational tool, the life course perspective as an organizing theoretical framework, and a thematic analysis tool1 to answer our research questions. Our analysis identified that timing and sequencing of life transitions and stress proliferation furthered the process of financial stress over time.Findings Cancer survivors do not experience financial toxicity as a singular process; the experience can be quite different depending on age and life transitions.Practice/Policy Implications These findings provide psychosocial oncology providers with a framework for identifying patients at risk for financial distress and addressing the critical needs related to their life stage.

T1  - Covariates of risky health behaviors in pediatric cancer survivors during adolescence
AN  - 2472035510
AB  - Purpose Adolescent survivors of pediatric cancers may use alcohol and tobacco (73–90% and 10–29%, respectively) at similar rates as their healthy peers despite known adverse health effects of these substances. This is concerning given that these behaviors can increase the risk for adverse late effects among this population. This study explores the beliefs and behaviors associated with alcohol and tobacco use among adolescent survivors of pediatric cancer.Design Cross-sectional study using assessment questionnaires by telephone.Participants Adolescent cancer survivors who had been seen at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (n = 128)Methods Questionnaires concerned participants’ medical history, current health behaviors, attitudes about health behaviors, fear of cancer recurrence, cancer worry, knowledge of risk, and perceived risk of future health problems. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses determined the association between psychological covariates with having ever used alcohol and cigarettes.Results In multiple logistic regression, higher positive attitude (OR = 3.65; p < 0.001) toward alcohol use and lower knowledge of the risk of binge drinking (OR = 0.38; p < 0.05) were significantly related to alcohol use. Older age (OR = 1.55; p < 0.01), lower knowledge of the risks of smoking (0.41; p < 0.05), and the subjective norm that smoking is desirable to others (OR = 1.90; p < 0.05) were significantly related to cigarette use.Conclusion and implications for psychosocial providers Understanding the uptake of risky health behaviors and factors related to tobacco and alcohol use for adolescent survivors is imperative to promoting lifelong healthy behaviors and potentially reducing future adverse health effects. Despite broadly disseminated public service campaigns and anticipatory guidance of our cancer specialists to inform youth about the adverse effects of alcohol and tobacco use, there remains a gap in adolescent cancer survivors’ knowledge of these risks. More effective interventions to increase knowledge of the risks of drinking and smoking are needed to bridge this gap.

T1  - PTSD as a Risk Factor Predicting Polydrug Use: A Dual Systems of Self-Control Mediation Model
AN  - 2472032808
AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased risk for polydrug use. Low self-control is a key characteristic of the disorder and is predictive of polydrug use. However, there is a dearth of research focused on the relevance of a dual systems model delineation of self-control into the constructs of risk-seeking and impulsivity as it pertains to polydrug use and PTSD. This study tested dual systems mediation of this relationship. Generalized structural equation modeling was used to test for mediation effects. Results indicated that more PTSD symptoms predicted increased drug use variety (coefficient = 0.024; confidence interval [CI] = [0.001, 0.046]). Inclusion of dual systems constructs fully attenuated this relationship. The total indirect effect achieved marginal significance (coefficient = 0.005; CI = [>−0.001, 0.009]). Sensitivity analyses of the specific indirect effect of impulsivity as the sole mediator indicated significant mediation. These results provide some indication that impulsivity-based programming may help to treat polydrug use among those with severe PTSD.

T1  - Participation in 12-Step Programs and Drug Use Among Older Adults With Cannabis Use Disorder: Six-Month Outcomes
AN  - 2472030405
AB  - This study examined associations among cannabis use disorder (CUD), 12-step program participation, and cannabis and other drug use at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Participants were age 50 or older in a study of veterans receiving medical management of alcohol and/or opioid withdrawal (N = 171). Generalized estimating equations examined the extent to which time point, 12-step program participation, and CUD were associated with change in number of cannabis and non-cannabis drug use days. Also examined was whether having CUD was associated with 12-step program participation. From baseline through the 6-month follow-up, 12-step program participation increased, non-cannabis drug use decreased, and cannabis use remained stable. Twelve-step program participation at baseline was associated with better outcomes at follow-ups. Participants with CUD reported less 12-step program participation and more cannabis use days at follow-ups. Older adults with CUD may need other types of psychosocial treatments due to low participation in 12-step programs.

T1  - Unemployment, sanctions and mental health: the relationship between benefit sanctions and antidepressant prescribing
AN  - 2471634516
AB  - International social security systems increasingly place work-related conditions on individuals claiming out-of-work benefits, and enforce requirements through the use of benefit sanctions. The literature on the impacts of benefit sanctions considers both labour market and wider social effects, which this study contributes to through a focus on mental health. It considers the period of Coalition government (2010–15) in the UK, which imposed a comparatively high number of benefit sanctions and increased their severity through the Welfare Reform Act 2012. A longitudinal dataset is constructed using quarterly local authority-level data on Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) sanctions and antidepressant prescriptions in England. Results from fixed effects analyses indicate that, in the post-reform period, every 10 additional sanctions are associated with 4.57 additional antidepressant prescribing items (95% CI: 2.14 to 6.99), which translates to approximately one additional person receiving treatment. Importantly, this finding indicates that sanctions are associated with both adverse mental health impacts and wider public expenditure implications, which motivates further investigation at the individual-level. In addition, punitive sanctions form a core part of the new Universal Credit (UC) and so the results suggest the need to reassess the use of sanctions within the contemporary social security system.

T1  - Age differences in attitudes about older adults with dementia
AN  - 2470170668
AB  - Dementia, a term that describes a variety of brain conditions marked by gradual, persistent and progressive cognitive decline, affects a significant proportion of older adults. Older adults with dementia are sometimes perceived less favourably than those without dementia. Furthermore, compared to persons without dementia, those with dementia are often perceived by others as having reduced personhood. This study was aimed at investigating whether differences in attitudes towards dementia and personhood perceptions vary as a function of age group, care-giver status, attitudes towards ageing, dementia knowledge, gender and education. In total 196 younger, middle-aged and older adults were recruited. Findings revealed that being a care-giver as well as having less ageist attitudes were predictive of being more comfortable around persons with dementia, having more knowledge about dementia and ascribing greater personhood to people with dementia. Those with more dementia knowledge (prior to the study) were less comfortable around people with dementia. Finally, when controlling this prior dementia knowledge, older adults were more comfortable around people with dementia compared to younger and middle-aged adults. Gender and education were not associated with any of the variables under study. Findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of age- and care-giver-related factors in the determination of attitudes towards dementia.

T1  - The impacts of gender on seasonal retirement mobility and wellbeing
AN  - 2470170658
AB  - With the increase in personal mobility and improvements in living standards, seasonal mobility for health reasons is a well-observed phenomenon among retired people worldwide. Existing studies have shown that there are relationships between seasonal retirement mobility and wellbeing, and this study attempts to explore the effects of gender on these relationships. The framework of therapeutic mobility, which includes daily activities, sociality and context, was used to analyse this relationship. Qualitative methods including semi-structured interviews, non-participatory observation and mobile ethnography were used to collect data. This study finds that female seasonal senior migrants in Sanya have more abundant and meaningful daily activities and receive more emotional supports, and as a result, gain more benefits than males, and that these differences are related to their gender roles. Furthermore, while gender itself cannot explain all the differences, it works within the intersection of economic condition, age and family support. This study has enriched the literature on therapeutic mobility and has practical implications.

T1  - ‘When it faded in her … it faded in me’: a qualitative study exploring the impact of care-giving on the experience of spousal intimacy for older male care-givers
AN  - 2470170647
AB  - Older male care-givers play an increasingly important role in informal care-giving, yet they have received little attention in the literature. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of care-giving on the experience of spousal intimacy for older male care-givers. Twenty-four older male care-givers, drawn from a region of the United Kingdom, participated in one-to-one interviews about their care-giving role. Thematic analysis was used to analyse data, and the study was underpinned by theories of masculinity. Three main themes were identified: (a) ‘Impact of care-giving on the experience of sexual intimacy’; (b) ‘Impact of care-giving on the experience of emotional intimacy’; and (c) ‘Not up for discussion’. When sexual intimacy declined, some older male care-givers prioritised emotional intimacy; some struggled with the decline; and some were reluctant to discuss the issue. Additionally, some care-givers reported that they had not received support from external support providers for declining sexual or emotional intimacy. Intimacy has been highlighted as important for care-givers given its link with care-giver wellbeing and quality of life. Results of this study suggest that sexual and emotional intimacy was an issue for older male care-givers, and that this issue should be considered by external support providers as part of a holistic assessment of need in order to tailor effective support.

T1  - ‘It's most of my life – going to the pub or the group’: the social networks of involuntarily childless older men
AN  - 2470170636
AB  - The social networks of older people are a significant influence on their health and wellbeing. Adult children are an important element in their parent's network and provide the majority of informal care. The morphology of personal networks alters with age, employment, gender and relationships. Not having children automatically reduces both vertical familial structure and affects the wider formal and informal social links that children can bring. Childless men are missing from gerontological, reproduction, sociological and psychological research. These fields have all mainly focused on family and women. This paper reports on an auto/biographical qualitative study framed by biographical, feminist, gerontological and lifecourse approaches. Data were gathered from semi-structured biographical interviews with 14 self-defined involuntarily childless men aged between 49 and 82 years old. A latent thematic analysis highlighted the complex intersections between childlessness and individual agency, relationships and socio-cultural structures. The impact of major lifecourse events and non-events had significant implications for how childless people perform and view their social and self-identity. I argue that involuntary childlessness affects the social, emotional and relational aspects of men's lived experience across the lifecourse.

T1  - Decomposing the effects of childhood adversity on later-life depression among Europeans: a comparative analysis by gender
AN  - 2470170635
AB  - The aims of the present study are twofold: first, to examine the importance of socio-economic disadvantage, adverse experiences and poor health in childhood on later-life depression by sex and, second, to discern the direct and indirect effects of childhood circumstances using a decomposition technique. Data are derived from Waves 2 and 3 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The methods involve use of logistic regression models and a decomposition approach. The findings indicate that childhood socio-economic status (SES) for both genders and cognitive function for men have only a significant direct effect, consistent with the critical period model. Childhood health for men and poor parental mental health for women are nearly fully mediated by adulthood and later-life circumstances, a fact in line with the pathway model. Poor childhood health, parental excessive alcohol consumption and cognitive function for women and adverse experiences for men have both significant direct and indirect effects, consistent with both models. Mediating factors include poor adulthood and later-life health, socio-economic adversity and stress; adulthood and later-life SES mediate early life health and adverse experiences more strongly for men, whereas stress seems to mediate early life adverse experiences to a greater extent among women. Intervening policies should address childhood adversity while considering the differential vulnerability of men and women.

T1  - Health Status among African Americans: Do Social Capital and Financial Satisfaction Make a Difference?
AN  - 2469744092
AB  - The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether various types of social capital influence self-rated health among African Americans, while accounting for objective and subjective economic well-being. This cross-sectional study included a nationally representative sample of 231 African American adults that participated in the Community Benchmark Survey. Hierarchical multiple regression results show that the health status was influenced by a positive Black identity, friendships, the quality of the communities in which they live, and objective and subjective SES factors. These are social resources and psychological assets that are germane in promoting better health appraisals among African Americans.

AN  - 2469501687
AB  - Purpose:  Forced displacement may increase the risk of child maltreatment and mental health problems among children and caregivers. This study assessed the acceptability and preliminary outcomes of a parenting intervention to prevent child maltreatment and improve parental and child mental health among Syrian refugees in Lebanon.  Method:  292 parents and 88 children participated in a structured assessment before and after a group-based parenting intervention implemented by an international nongovernmental organization serving refugee and vulnerable Lebanese communities.  Results:  Paired sample t tests showed significant reductions in harsh punishment and rejecting parenting behavior and significant improvements in measures of parental and child mental health from pre- to postintervention. On average, parents completed 7.7 of 10 sessions.  Discussion:  Preliminary results suggest that the parenting intervention was acceptable to refugee parents and may show promise in reducing child maltreatment and improving parental and child mental health in a humanitarian setting.

T1  - Feasibility of the <i>Hand in Hand</i> Relationship Intervention for Stroke Survivor–Caregiver Dyads: A Randomized Trial
AN  - 2469501421
AB  - Purpose:  A strong interpersonal relationship after stroke is important for the prevention of depression in survivors and family caregivers. This study aimed to test the feasibility of quality of relationship intervention for stroke dyads called Hand in Hand (HiH).  Methods:  Sixteen dyads were randomized into either the HiH group (n = 8) or information, support, and referral (ISR) control group (n = 8). HiH dyads received up to eight sessions, with topics prioritized according to a 17-item screening tool. ISR dyads received up to eight sessions that included information, active listening, and referrals. Feasibility, acceptability, and outcomes data were collected for both groups.  Results:  The HiH and ISR groups were feasible and acceptable. Caregivers in both groups, as well as survivors in the ISR group, experienced improvements in depressive symptoms and other select outcomes.  Conclusions:  Findings suggest that HiH is feasible to implement with stroke dyads and that it merits further refinement and testing.

T1  - Strength-Based Flourishing Intervention to Promote Resilience in Individuals With Physical Disabilities in Disadvantaged Communities: A Randomized Controlled Trial
AN  - 2469501200
AB  - Purpose:  The current study developed a strength-based flourishing intervention (SFI) and examined its efficacy on fostering the resilience of people with physical disabilities in poor areas, using a randomized (1:1) parallel-group controlled, and single-blind trial.  Method:  A total of 51 participants (Mage = 42.16, standard deviation = 8.42; 43.14% males; 29 for the intervention group, whereas 22 for the control group) completed preintervention, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up tests.  Results:  The 2 × 3 mixed repeated measure analyses and post hoc analyses revealed a significant main group effect (F = 4.46, p = .04) and a short-term effect (i.e., 3 month; F = 6.35, p = .02) of the SFI. The results indicated that the SFI could significantly promote resilience in the intervention group. However, the effects of the intervention did not immediately appear.  Discussion:  The SFI could assist in providing research-based and cost-effective health services to promote flourishing and resilience in vulnerable populations.

T1  - Parental Attitudes, Roles and Influences on Decision Making for Child Well-being on the South Coast of Kenya—a Descriptive Study
AN  - 2469500251
AB  - While it is well-accepted that mothers play a key role in child health outcomes, the role of the father is less well understood. This study, the first of two investigations of the relationship between the social environment and child health, growth and development, was nested in a child nutrition programme carried out in Kwale County. At present child health services are largely administered through government Mother and Child Health programmes. Previous community consultations have raised the need to include all family members, particularly fathers, in the process of addressing child health and development issues. To provide a background to planning for inclusion of the wider family this study investigated local attitudes and beliefs towards parenting and how these may influence child health outcomes. In this study, we used qualitative in-depth interviews of 61 co-habiting couples with fathers and mothers interviewed separately, analysed using NVivo 10 software, to look for patterns of responses with regards to attitudes and behaviours relevant to child health. The study findings suggested that both mothers and fathers overall valued their status as parents and were willing to be involved in promoting the well-being of their children. Fathers and mothers saw that they carried out a different role, and drew on different influences in their decision making and role definition. The main barrier to direct paternal involvement in the health care of their children was reported to be the cost of attendance at clinics, both in terms of time and money. Innovation in how medical services engage with families is required to increase the supportive role that fathers can provide by using opportunities such as community meetings where men gather to explain child health risks and preventative measures.

T1  - Stress and Coping: Considering the Influence of Psychological Strengths on the Mental Health of At-Risk South African Adolescents
AN  - 2469499934
AB  - In South Africa, many adolescents are affected by socio-economic adversity, which increases their susceptibility to experiencing stress that negatively affects their mental health. The synthesis of international literature has identified the psychological strengths (that include perceived social support, self-esteem and resilience) as having a protective effect on the mental health of at-risk adolescents who experience stress. Against this background, we argue that psychological strengths may assist South African adolescents in coping with stressors and may mediate the impact of stress on the mental health of adolescents living in conditions of socio-economic adversity. Given that this remains an under-researched area in the South African context, we also highlight the need for South African research that prioritizes the exploration of factors mitigating the experience of stress for adolescents. We also posit that such research should have significant implications for mental-health policy, practice, mental-health promotion and the prevention of mental disorders. We believe that such scholarly inquiries would be central to the intervention strategies aimed at preventing or “containing” the scourge of poverty-induced psychological distress in South African youth.

T1  - Implementation of individual placement and support in a first‐episode psychosis unit: A new way of working
AN  - 2468555901
AB  - The aim of this study is to explore the IPS implementation process in a first‐episode psychosis (FEP) mental health service team in Sweden. More specifically, the study explores how integration processes and critical situations are perceived over time by team members who originated from two diverse welfare organizations. A serial interview design was used (initially, at 6 and 12 months) to describe experiences of 16 team members. Material was analyzed using a constant comparison grounded theory approach. Team members dealt with the ambivalence of sharing mental health information, and whether the new way of working was a risk or benefit for users. They gradually learned new perspectives and knowledge, built trust and shared common views. After a year, the team workload perceived reduced and became person‐centred. Some members described remaining unclear roles and requested further support. Negotiated goals for integration and early knowledge transfer are critical. Organizational change and trusting team relationships have to be facilitated. Anticipated gains of integration should be clearly described and discussed early on, and continuous support for sustainability should be considered. This study confirmed the importance and potential of integrating IPS into FEP teams.

T1  - Punitive welfare reform and claimant mental health: The impact of benefit sanctions on anxiety and depression
AN  - 2468555870
AB  - Internationally, policymakers assume that sanctioning claimants of unemployment benefits will engender both improved employment outcomes and wider positive effects. A growing evidence‐base challenges these expectations, though additional insight is needed from large‐scale longitudinal research. This article contributes by conducting a quantitative investigation into the mental health impacts of benefit sanctions. To do so, it focuses on a recent period in UK sanctions policy in which rates of sanctions varied markedly and their length was substantially increased. Using quarterly panel data for local authorities in England (Q3 2010–Q4 2014) and fixed effects models that control for important confounders, the analysis provides robust evidence that Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) sanctions lead to increases in self‐reported anxiety and depression. Evidence of this adverse impact is particularly clear following the increase in the length of sanctions in October 2012. The results have important implications for contemporary social security policy, which is underpinned by a similarly punitive sanctions regime. Whilst additional individual‐level research is needed to fully consider the causal relationships in operation, the findings support a precautionary approach that should seek to minimise the harm associated with sanctions. This implies taking steps to reduce both the severity and frequency of applied sanctions.

AB  - This study explores the associations of retirement, and of public and private pensions, with older adults’ depressive symptoms by comparing differences between countries and age groups. Harmonized data were analyzed from the family of Health and Retirement Study in 2012–2013 from China, England, Mexico, and the United States (n = 97,978). Respondents were asked if they were retired and received public or private pensions. Depressive symptom was measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Retirement was significantly associated with higher depressive symptoms for the United States and with lower depressive symptoms for Mexico and England. Public pension was significantly associated with lower depressive symptoms for Mexico and with higher depressive symptoms for the United States and China. Private pension was significantly associated with lower depressive symptoms for the United States, China, and England. Our study shows that continuity theory demonstrates cross-national variation in explaining the association between retirement and depressive symptoms.

T1  - Music Training Improves Depressed Mood Symptoms in Elderly People: A Randomized Controlled Trial
AN  - 2466210376
AB  - The effectiveness of music training on depressed mood and general cognitive function in elderly participants is verified in this study. Music activities consisted of improvisation exercises for stimulating interpersonal skills, mood, and cognitive functions. A mixed research method was adopted, including standardized measures (Mini-Mental State Examination and Geriatric Depression Scale) and follow-up semistructured interviews. The research design included pre- and postevaluation with randomized experimental and control groups. Participants were 45 care residents aged 62 to 95, healthy and with cognitive impairment. Results revealed a significant improvement in depression index (Geriatric Depression Scale) for the experimental period (t = 1.450; p < .005; d = 0.453) while the control group had no improvement (t = 0.080; p > .1; d = 0.025). In addition, a significant improvement was found in the cognitive level (Mini-Mental State Examination) for the experimental (t = 2.300; p < .005; d = 0.668) than the control group that had a significant reduction (t = 1.240; p < .05; d = 0.273). This study provides evidence that music training has a positive impact on depressed mood and general cognitive function in elderly participants. These types of music training sessions could provide aid to control the symptoms of depression, delay the deterioration of cognitive function, and enhance social–cognitive function, especially in individuals presenting with cognitive impairment.

T1  - Social Support, Basic Psychological Needs, and Social Well-Being Among Older Cancer Survivors
AN  - 2466210354
AB  - This study examined the contribution of social support and satisfaction of basic psychological needs in predicting social well-being among older cancer survivors, from the perspective of self-determination theory. The sample for this study derived from the third wave of the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States. Participants consisted of 376 cancer survivors who had completed cancer treatment. The results of this study suggested that social support from family members and friends was a significant predictor of social well-being. Satisfaction of the basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) was a significant predictor of social well-being. The fulfillment of basic psychological needs among older cancer survivors is important to the experience of greater social well-being, a finding that contributes to the development of a dynamic model of motivation, engagement in social activity, and successful reintegration into one’s community.

T1  - Elder Mistreatment in an Italian Population: Prevalence and Correlates
AN  - 2466210170
AB  - This study aimed to examine the prevalence of elder mistreatment (EM) in an Italian population and to determine the risk factors. The sample consisted of 393 older adults (Mage = 77.07; standard deviation = 9.45) of whom 60.1% were females. The prevalence of EM was of 20.1%. Older elders who were separated, divorced, with a poor state of health, and problems of autonomy were more likely to experience EM. The most common forms of EM were physical/sexual (9.9%) and emotional mistreatment (9.9%). The most common perpetrators were paid caregivers and members of the victim’s family. A path analysis model suggested that limited autonomy and poor perceived health status appeared to be predictors of EM. We conclude that the results of this study have important implications in terms of reducing mistreatment of older adults. Understanding EM is essential to promoting equality, tolerance, and supportive attitudes and developing better prevention policies and practices.

T1  - Community-Dwelling and Recently Widowed Older Adults: Effects of Spousal Loss on Psychological Well-Being, Perceived Quality of Life, and Health-Care Costs
AN  - 2466210112
AB  - This study is on the effects of spousal loss among older adults who continue to live independently after bereavement. Little longitudinal studies focus on this group, which is of special interest, since in many countries, care policy and system reform are aimed at increasing independent living among older adults. Using longitudinal data from a Dutch public data repository, we investigate the effects of spousal loss on psychological well-being, perceived quality of life, and (indication of) yearly health-care costs. Of the respondents who had a spouse and were living independently (N = 9,400) at baseline, the majority had not lost their spouse after 12 months (T12, n = 9,150), but 2.7% (n = 250) had lost their spouse and still lived independently. We compared both groups using multivariate regression (ordinary least squares) analyses. The results show that spousal loss significantly lowers scores on psychological well-being and perceived quality of life, but we found no effect on health-care costs.

T1  - Depression Illness Representations Among Arabs in Israel: a Qualitative Study Comparing Younger and Older Adults
AN  - 2471647637
AB  - There has been a noticeable increase in the number of studies assessing perceptions regarding depression (illness representations) among people diagnosed with the disorder. However, these studies have examined mainly younger adults (ages 18 to 65), and very little is known about older adults. This study examined illness representations among younger and older Israeli Arabs with depression based on the Self-Regulation Model (SRM). A total of 12 Israeli Arabs (six younger adults aged 18–64 and six older adults aged 65+) diagnosed with depression took part in semi-structured, in-depth interviews. The majority of the participants in the younger group were female and married, compared to the older group which has a gender equal ratio, half of which are married. The data were analyzed thematically, guided by the SRM illness representations’ dimensions (identity; timeline; cause; consequences; control/cure; cyclical and coherence; and emotional representations). Differences between younger and older adults were found in some of the illness representations. Older adults described depression as a chronic illness associated with somatic symptoms, and did not believe in psychological treatment. Younger adults did not perceive depression as chronic, reported cognitive and emotional symptoms, and believed in the efficacy of psychological treatment. Our findings indicated that participants’ perceptions about depression appeared to be associated with their age, along with their unique cultural background as they are traditional but undergoing processes of modernization. This study stress the importance of illness representations in intervention programs tailored for different age groups, and considering their specific cultural needs.

T1  - Exploring the Perceptions of the Ageing Experience in Singaporean Older Adults: a Qualitative Study
AN  - 2471638560
AB  - Understanding older adults perceptions of health and adaptation processes to ageing can allow for more culturally aligned services and better targeted care. The aim of this exploratory qualitative study was to examine older adults perceptions of physical, psychological and social health and further understand the processes of adaptation and self-management of these health perceptions. Semi-structured in depth interviews (IDI) were conducted with ethnically diverse older adults in Singapore, aged 60 and above. Participants were asked open ended questions about their physical health, psychological health and their current social health and relationships. They were also asked methods of adaptation to these age related changes. In total, forty participants were interviewed. A thematic analysis identified five main themes when exploring perceptions of physical, psychological and social health. These included; 1) Slowing down 2) Relationship harmony 3) Financial harmony 4) Social connectedness and 5) Eating together. Adaptation and self-management of these health perceptions included six additional themes; 1) Keep moving 2) Keep learning; where continued self-determination and resilience was a key method in adapting to negative thoughts about declining physical health 3) Adopting avoidant coping behaviours 4) ‘It feels good to do good’; where finding meaning in life was to help others 5) ‘Power of Prayer’; which highlighted how older adults relegated responsibilities to a higher spiritual power 6) Social participation; which included engaging in community and religious social activities that all contributed to self-management of older adults psychological health and social health. In conclusion, our study highlighted specific cultural nuances in older adults perceptions of health, particularly psychological and social health. These findings can help develop more targeted intervention programmes and better methods of measuring older adults health, which can assist with the global ageing phenomena.

T1  - Self-Regulation, Marital Climate, and Emotional Well-Being among Japanese Older Couples
AN  - 2471638529
AB  - Although the association of self-regulation and well-being are well researched, few studies have addressed the dynamic mechanism of this relationship within married couples. This study examined the relationships of self-regulation and marital climate with the emotional well-being of both actors and partners among older Japanese couples. Through a mail survey, 498 older couples with husbands (aged in their 70s) and their wives (aged 60 or over) responded to a questionnaire comprising measures of selective optimization with compensation (SOC), tenacious goal pursuit and flexible goal adjustment, marital climate, and emotional well-being. The results of hierarchical linear modeling showed that positive interpretation was associated with not only their own lower depressive symptomatology and higher life satisfaction but also those of their partners. Furthermore, tenacious goal pursuit was beneficially associated with older adults’ life satisfaction. Marital climate was positively related to emotional well-being and the association was larger among wives than among husbands. However, contrary to expectations, use of an optimization strategy was negatively linked to partners’ life satisfaction, but not actors’. Besides confirming the apparent benefits of self-regulation for actors’ well-being, self-regulation could be beneficially or detrimentally related to partners’ well-being. To be happy in old age, it seems more important for individuals to care for their spouses and create a favorable marital climate than to pursue their own goals exclusively. There remains, however, a need to simultaneously examine the associations of both intrapersonal (self) and interpersonal (collective) regulatory processes with well-being.

T1  - Smartphone Addiction and Bonding Social Capital Among University Students of Youth Community in Bangladesh
AN  - 2471520432
AB  - The main objective of this paper was to examine the effects of smartphone addiction on bonding social capital among the university students in Bangladesh, for which measurement of smartphone addiction has been a correlated precondition of the study. In this connection, the main argument of this paper is that the accessibility of online-based smartphone apps alarmingly increases the compulsive use of smartphone mainly among the youth community in Bangladesh. The study employed a social survey method where data were collected through a face-to-face interview with a structured questionnaire. The study used a stratified random sampling with a sample size of 384 in the public and private university students in Bangladesh. Results show that 28 percent of the university students are addicted to the smartphone which has greater impacts on their primordial social relation as well as bonding social capital. The statistical findings also reveal that smartphone addiction weakens attachment to their family, close friends, and relatives despite having more communicational and interactional benefits from them. Specifically, the addictive use of smartphone reduces emotional sharing, interior intimacy, and responsibility toward the nearest one, but these adverse effects are highly predicted by the adaptive dysfunctions as social symptoms and by the psychological state of feeling panic and anxious without a smartphone. The study findings would be the important guideline for the policymakers, education and development practitioners, community development and youth welfare workers, social scientists, and human rights workers.

T1  - The Barriers of Financial Support Towards Successful Aging Among the Participants of Activity Center for the Older Persons in Malaysia
AN  - 2471518942
AB  - The study aimed to explore the barriers of financial support experienced by the elderly in pursuing successful aging, and it recommends some solutions to overcome those barriers. This study adopted a qualitative case study approach using an in-depth case interview, where a thematic analysis technique was used to present study findings. This study involved 24 elderly people in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and government agencies which were related to the social welfare of the elderly. Results showed that the lack of awareness and knowledge, poor family relationships, low household incomes, and institutional constraints were among the barriers of financial support faced by the elderly which have led to a lower quality of life and thus hindered progress towards successful aging. The study recommends to minimize the reliance of elderly people on family or government by providing them with compatible income sources as well as financial management and planning at an early age. The study also recommends the policymakers to consider the skills and experiences of those elderly people before issuing any policy regarding human capital.

T1  - Patterns of Living Environment Among Itinerant Elderly Community in Malaysia
AN  - 2471518824
AB  - This qualitative research aims to explore the life stories of the itinerant elderly in shelter homes and vagrancy by the series of semi-structured interviews with fourteen folks in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The data was collected using the snowball sampling and analyzed by using interpretative phenomenological analysis that managed to categorize the data into various themes and subthemes. Results showed that although there are variations in the living patterns and living environment at the care homes and public places, the destitute elderly’s mental condition matched to a great extent because they were in the same phase of life. The study recommends the establishment of temporary residences for elderly living in the streets to improve their health, hygiene, security, and shelter facility along with the provision of some form of privacy in sheltered institutions and panopticon instead of being left homeless to respect their dignity and independence.

T1  - Vulnerabilities of River Erosion–Affected Coastal Communities in Bangladesh: a Menu of Alternative Livelihood Options
AN  - 2471518469
AB  - In the context of generally limited research on the subject, this study aims to (i) unravel the nature, forms, and manifestations of socioeconomic and psychological vulnerabilities of the river erosion–affected coastal communities in Bangladesh and (ii) suggest a number of alternative livelihood options in order to reduce the vulnerabilities. It draws on a mixed-method approach. The fieldwork was conducted in three unions representing three upazilas (sub-districts) of the Bhola District. Quantitative data were collected using a structured interview schedule from 371 household heads, while the qualitative data were generated through in-depth case interviews, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. The results show that the river erosion wreaked havoc on the communities’ physical resources and increased their psychosocial vulnerabilities such as forced displacement, social insecurity, food insecurity, breakdown of socio-cultural bondage and networks, and decreased social esteem. The lack of livelihood options coupled with poor and fragile household conditions contribute to the reduced ability of the communities to cope with the post-disaster problems. The low level of participation of the river erosion–affected people in disaster construction, planning, and programs results in a weakened state of community resilience which further increases vulnerability in the future. Based on the overall observations of the study, a number of community-led alternative livelihood options are then suggested including adoption of innovative production and processing measures, formation of self-help groups, entrepreneurship development, priority basis livelihood options based on local context, and use of indigenous knowledge and skills-based coping strategies. The findings may provide useful lessons and ameliorative clues to the policy makers, and (disaster and development) practitioners.

T1  - An Assessment Approach for Use in Counselling to Promote Young People’s Quality of Life
AN  - 2471467012
AB  - Quality of life (QOL) has come to be considered a primary outcome of service delivery for children and youth. Still, after decades of debate, no consensus exists regarding what this concept means or how to measure it. There has been a multitude of instruments used to measure this outcome for young people. The majority of these tools have focused on health and functioning, with little attention paid to other aspects of life that may matter to the QOL of children and youth and, more generally, what QOL specifically means to them. This paper provides a brief overview of the current approaches to conceptualizing and measuring young people’s QOL and related issues. It then considers one potential assessment approach that could be used by various types of counsellors (e.g., education, mental health, rehabilitation, family). This approach is based on the available literature that has explored the perspectives of young people, both with and without chronic conditions and disabilities, regarding what QOL means to them. It will then be discussed how this approach may provide a valid, efficient, positively-oriented, relationship-centred way for counsellors to accurately identify needs and goals to target for intervention that are meaningful and interrelated within the overall context of a young client’s life and long-term development. Directions for future research are presented.

T1  - Factors Influencing Life Satisfaction of International Students in Mainland China
AN  - 2471466982
AB  - China is advancing in its bid to internationalize higher education, but little is known to date about the life satisfaction of overseas students in that country. Life satisfaction can be understood as the extent to which individuals’ experiences in a host country help them achieve their personal goals and satisfy their expectations regarding acculturation. This paper examines past research, especially international literature, to provide an overview of factors that may influence the life satisfaction of international students in countries other than their own, and looks particularly at those matters that may also affect overseas students in China. Comparisons are made between variables identified in general and those in Asia, and specifically China. The findings have implications for policy-makers and university practitioners seeking to improve educational quality and counseling support services for international students.

T1  - <i>Needles Don't Agree with Me, Pills Don't Agree with Me</i>: Experiences of Contraceptive Use among Pakhtun Women in Pakistan
AN  - 2470859593
AB  - The sixth most populous country, Pakistan's modern contraceptive use rate is just 25%. Of the multiple reasons for avoiding contraceptives, women cite side effects as a significant deterrent to contraceptive uptake. Efforts to understand these side effects are limited by overreliance on the biomedical framework, which typically dismisses some of women's negative experiences and explanatory models as misperceptions. Drawing on 13 months of ethnographic data from a village in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, our study sought to provide an emic description of contraceptive side effects. Respondents’ described what we call “spiritual” and “somatic” side effects. While the latter included experiences such as irregular bleeding and leg pain, spiritual side effects had more severe implications ranging from job loss, birth defects, to child death. In a context of a firm belief that family planning was a sin, contraceptives were believed to negatively impact spiritual well‐being and invite God's wrath. Our data suggest these perceptions and experiences played a crucial role in contraceptive decision‐making. The spiritual and somatic experiences of contraceptive use described by respondents also demonstrate the importance of broadening dominant biomedical approaches to holistically understand contraceptive side effects and usage.

T1  - No room at the inn? Re-imagining social inclusion at the intersections between climate change, globalisation, homelessness, and human migration
AN  - 2470590087
AB  - There are two dominant and competing ways of conceptualising the psychosocial dynamics of social inclusion. In ‘Metropolitan’ systems, if you’re the wrong side of that line which denotes who’s ‘in’ and who’s ‘out’, you’re excluded and oppressed, but you can ‘come in from the cold’ if you accept the terms of the invitation. In ‘Cosmopolitan’ systems, there are different accounts and practices, but essentially there’s a ‘comprehending circle’ involved, in which all are included by being drawn in towards the centre. Climate disaster threatens to overturn these paradigms. I build upon Latour’s work on the new politics of globalisation, as well as upon my previous (co-authored) work concerning Diogenes of Sinope, who coined the term ‘Kosmopolitēs’. The figure of Diogenes may stand for a third position: a monadic figure beyond system and order. This third position illuminates fraught encounters between imperialist in-groups and colonised out-groups in late modernity. The Keeling Count at Mauna Loa is a register whose implications suggest that, in the Anthropocene, we are all unhoused. Latour’s ‘migrations without form or nation’ of ‘climate, erosion, pollution, resource depletion, habitat destruction’ threaten to make migrants of us all – or, to remind us that once we all were migrants.

T1  - We need to (find a way to) talk about … Eco-anxiety
AN  - 2470588447
AB  - Eco-anxiety may not be new, but could now be seen as an emergent phenomenon attracting increasing attention as public awareness about the climate and bio-diversity crisis grows. There may also be some generational differences in how we respond emotionally, with children often talking about feelings framed by their experience of adult misunderstanding or inaction. What often scares children the most is how they see the ‘adult world’ failing to take sufficient urgent action on these threats, whilst at the same time dismissing, criminalising, pathologising and patronising their feelings and voices. Children and young people are increasingly taking centre stage in protests about the need to take urgent action, whilst simultaneously often being the focus of society’s anxieties about the psychological impact of the crises; ‘we mustn’t frighten the children’. This paper focuses on children and young people’s perspectives; introducing eco-anxiety, drawing on clinical practice examples, research findings and finally offering conceptual frames to help us broaden and deepen our understanding of this evolving syndrome.

T1  - Police reform, austerity and ‘cop culture’: time to change the record?
AN  - 2470251322
AB  - Austerity, a politicised police reform agenda and increasing demand for police services create the collective conditions that require classical views of police culture be seen through a fresh contextual lens. Triangulating participant observation, semi-structured interviews and archival and documentary review within two UK police forces, we identify dramatic organisational and environmental changes across the UK policing landscape as the prime factors reconceptualising traditional views of police cultural theory. We argue for a context-specific, more pluralistic understanding, highlighting the importance within current police culture of public service motivation and the role of public servant, reduced intra-group solidarity and concepts of victim categorisation differing from previous typologies. Some facets of traditional concepts of police culture, such as residual racism, are resilient; other aspects, such as the role of autonomy and the meaning ascribed to getting a ‘result’, are now better understood in novel ways.

T1  - How law shapes policing: the regulation of alcohol in the U.S., 1750–1860
AN  - 2470251234
AB  - Scholars have been skeptical about the capacity of law to shape what police do, but that skepticism results from a myopic view of the relationship between legal systems and policing practices. This paper develops a more holistic view of that relationship by exploring the legal standards, social understandings, and policing practices that played a role in the regulation of alcohol and drunkenness from roughly 1750–1860 in the United States. From the late colonial period through the 1830s, alcohol regulation did not aim to reduce drinking but to prevent public disorder – a task that was well-suited to the character of the early American legal system. From the 1830s through 1860, however, the temperance movement successfully pressed legislators to enact more explicitly moralistic liquor laws, demanding that police ferret out private alcohol sales rather than merely regulating their impact on public order. That new mandate quickly unravelled, for it proved incompatible with a wide range of legal restraints, including traditional protections against searches of private homes, skepticism about the testimony by criminal accomplices, and liability rules related to official enforcement actions. No single restriction on policing tactics undermined antebellum prohibition, but the basic orientation of criminal procedure and the social understandings and practices through which it operated informed a wide range of specific restrictions on morals policing that collectively made prohibition unworkable. To understand that story, we need to take a broader view of the relationship between law and policing than most policing research has taken.

T1  - Exploring police response and interaction with people with mental illness in Guyana
AN  - 2470251139
AB  - In many developing countries, police officers are called upon to intervene in matters related to people with mental illness (PMI) and therefore constitute an important facet of pathways to medical care. Globally, police officers come into frequent contact with PMI and they (police) play a central role in the management of these individuals, however, police-PMI contact pose complex challenges for most police officers. Instructively, mental health professionals contend that police officers are not best suited to handle PMI and that many PMI are incarcerated, seriously injured or die as a result of their contact with the police. This study explores police officers’ attitude, response and interaction with PMI in Guyana in order to assist with the development of appropriate interventions when policing PMI. The study utilises a random sample of police officers (N = 130) from the Guyana Police Force (GPF) to achieve the study’s objectives. A modified variant of the Mental Health Attitude Survey for Police (MHASP) was used to garner the views of the participants. The findings indicate: (1) that a considerable amount of police time was spent dealing with PMI each week, (2) that contact with PMI pose considerable difficulties for police officers, (3) that the most common police interactions with PMI were investigations, arrests and conveying PMI to hospitals, (4) that police training on responding to PMI is insufficient, and (5) that mental health training can improve officers’ ability to efficiently police PMI. Recommendations for training, directions for future research and policy implications are also discussed.

T1  - Police officer transitions to retirement in the United Kingdom: social identity, social support, and (in)justice
AN  - 2470250960
AB  - This article draws on qualitative interviews to examine police officers’ experiences of transitioning to retirement in the United Kingdom, a matter that has been hitherto under researched. We find that the well-established routines and the social identity conferred by the police role are severed at retirement and the transition to retirement may be experienced as disruptive. This has implications for self-esteem, access to support, and perceptions of fairness of the organisation. However, we further argue that retirement is a multidimensional concept and experienced differently, depending on the context and circumstances in which it occurs. When officers are underprepared or retired for medical reasons, the transition was especially disruptive. The article makes important contributions to the literature on police officer social identity, well-being, and organisational justice.

T1  - COVID-19 and residential care facilities: issues and concerns identified by the international network prevention of elder abuse (INPEA)
AN  - 2467523521
AB  - PurposeThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected the physical, psychological, social and financial health of older persons. On this subject, the United Nations published a policy brief on the impact of COVID-19 on older persons in May 2020. In line with this, the purpose of this general review is to address three issues affecting older persons living in residential care facilities: protective measures implemented to block the virus’ entry, the types of mistreatment most frequently experienced and the necessity to promote and defend the rights of these persons.Design/methodology/approachThe design of this study is based on input gathered since the end of April during meetings of the International Network for the Prevention of Elder Abuse (INPEA) and the results of a July survey of its members.FindingsThe survey results indicate variability in the implementation of protective measures in different countries and the significant presence of mistreatment and violation of the rights of older persons. Three major issues demand attention: ageism, systemic and managerial problems and the effects of implemented measures. All these prompt the INPEA to once again plea for the adoption of an international convention of human rights of older persons.Originality/valueTo our knowledge, this is the first article sharing the views of the INPEA from a global perspective in the context of COVID-19.

T1  - The Emergence of COVID-19 in the US: A Public Health and Political Communication Crisis
AN  - 2466201064
AB  - The coronavirus public health crisis is also a political-communication and health-communication crisis. In this article, the authors describe the key communication-related phenomena and evidence of concerning effects manifested in the United States during the initial response to the pandemic. The authors outline the conditions of communication about coronavirus that contribute to deleterious outcomes, including partisan cueing, conflicting science, downplayed threats, emotional arousal, fragmented media, and Trump's messaging. The authors suggest these have contributed to divergent responses by media sources, partisan leaders, and the public alike, leading to different attitudes and beliefs as well as varying protective actions taken by members of the public to reduce their risk. In turn, these divergent communication phenomena will likely amplify geographic variation in and inequities with COVID-19 disease outcomes. The authors conclude with some suggestions for future research, particularly surrounding communication about health inequity and strategies for reducing partisan divergence in views of public health issues in the future.

T1  - Saving for college: perspectives from participants in a universal children’s savings program
AN  - 2465704167
AB  - As the cost of college education continues climbing, college affordability eludes many low- to moderate-income families. Children’s Savings Accounts (CSAs) have been proposed as potential resources to build assets and help save for postsecondary education. While a large body of CSA research consists of testing relationships between program participation and well-being indicators, few endeavors have been dedicated to understanding CSA participants’ program experiences. This study analyzes in-depth interviews with parents of children enrolled in a statewide CSA program to gain an understanding of families’ experiences of saving for postsecondary education. Specifically, this study aims to understand the implementation of the program related to participant enrollment and the extent to which the program influenced participants and encouraged saving for postsecondary education, if at all. Findings on parents’ experiences enrolling in the Harold Alfond College Challenge (HACC), perceived influence of HACC participation, and experiences of saving for postsecondary education offer insights on the design and implementation of future CSA programs.

T1  - Assessment and screening of positive childhood experiences along with childhood adversity in research, practice, and policy
AN  - 2465704143
AB  - Despite empirical evidence documenting the role of positive childhood experiences in predicting adaptation over the lifespan and across generations, this research has not yet been fully integrated into public health and policy efforts. We argue that adults' benevolent childhood experiences (BCEs) should be measured in large-scale data collection efforts, such as statewide surveys, alongside more routinely collected adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). We also outline several recommended strategies in which the assessment and screening of positive childhood experiences could be implemented as a counterpart to community health and primary care screening for childhood adversity in adults, with short- and long-term benefits. Pediatric physicians should screen children and adolescents for their current positive childhood experiences as well. The assessment of positive childhood experiences is essential to empirically identifying resilience resources linked with better long-term adaptation, understanding how positive experiences may counteract the long-term effects of childhood adversity in underserved and traumatized individuals, informing medical providers' knowledge about patients' strengths in addition to challenges, and instilling hope in individuals and families experiencing stress.

T1  - Using Youth Risk Behavior Survey data to analyze housing instability among Delaware public school students
AN  - 2465704132
AB  - This study provides information about the prevalence, living conditions, and demographic characteristics of housing instability among students in the state of Delaware. Data were obtained from the Delaware Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) for the 2011–2017 academic years and included 23,819 youth respondents in grades 6–12. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted to characterize student demographics. Results show that 3.6% (about one out of 30) of Delaware students, grades 6–12, experience housing instability, and this rate was consistent across urban and rural areas. Findings also reveal that males and students of color were more likely to experience housing instability. Results obtained are utilized to understand the prevalence of housing instability and to inform schools, communities, and policy makers of ways to support and strengthen services and programming for students’ academic needs and well-being.

T1  - Risk-taking behaviors of homeless youth: moderation by parental monitoring and social support
AN  - 2465704130
AB  - Adolescence is a critical developmental period when youth are transitioning to be more independent while also being at heightened risk for negative developmental trajectories. This is especially true for adolescent youth experiencing homelessness. Using state population-representative 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data, we examined the association between youth homelessness and engagement in risk-taking behaviors. The moderating roles of parental monitoring and social support were also examined. We found that 2.8% (8,922) of students were experiencing homelessness, and youth homelessness was associated with engagement in a greater number of risk-taking behavior types. The association between youth homelessness and risk-taking behaviors was not moderated by parental monitoring, which was high for stably housed youth as well as homeless youth. Social support was a significant moderator. For stably housed youth, the presence of someone to talk to when youth were feeling sad was associated with engagement in fewer risk-taking behaviors. Conversely, for homeless youth, having someone to talk to when the youth were feeling sad was associated with higher engagement in risk-taking behaviors. Findings extend our understanding of risk-taking behaviors among homeless youth, a particularly vulnerable group of adolescents. The study has implications for prevention and intervention efforts to support homeless youth.

T1  - Associations between parent-reported family economic hardship and mental health conditions in U.S. children
AN  - 2465703593
AB  - This study examines the association between parent-reported family economic hardship (FEH) and child mental health conditions. We hypothesized a positive association between parent perceptions of FEH and child mental health conditions that would persist after controlling for underlying demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Cross-sectional data came from the 2016 and 2017 National Surveys of Children's Health (NSCH), nationally representative surveys of non-institutionalized children in the United States, aged 0–17 years. We conducted chi-square as well as multivariable logistic regression analyses to investigate the relationships between FEH and internalizing disorders and behavioral/conduct problems among children ages 3–17 years. Overall, one in four children experienced FEH during their lifetime. FEH was statistically significantly (p < 0.0001) and positively correlated with each mental health condition, and the association remained after adjusting for covariates. Specifically, FEH was associated with 84% increased odds of having an internalizing disorder (OR = 1.84, 95%, CI: 1.54–2.20) and 53% increased odds of having behavioral/conduct problems (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.25–1.87). Findings suggest that income alone may be an insufficient predictor of the health risks of economic hardship. Further research should examine FEH as a broader measure of disadvantage and its relationship with child health.

T1  - Effectiveness of Combined Cognitive and Physical Interventions to Enhance Functioning in Older Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials
AN  - 2464404616
AB  - Background and Objectives Cognitive training delivered in conjunction with physical activity, may help to optimize aging and delay or prevent dementia in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, their efficacy is less well studied compared to pharmaceutical treatments. This systematic review synthesizes the emerging evidence on combined cognitive-physical interventions for enhancing functioning in older adults with MCI, with implications for practice and research. Research Design and Methods We searched the PubMed, PsycINFO, Ageline, Medline, Web of Science and ProQuest databases, and hand-searched articles published between July 2013 and November 2018. Only randomized controlled trials which incorporated cognitive and physical components targeted to individuals with MCI over the age of 50 were eligible. Our search yielded 10 eligible, independent articles. Results Intervention participants with MCI self-reported, or demonstrated, improved functioning across a range of cognitive (global cognitive function, executive function, processing speed, memory, attention, mood, emotion, motivation, brain cortex, orientation), and physical (gait, balance, mobility) outcomes. Interventions which combined cognitive-physical training were comparable to those which isolated these same elements, in terms of their effects on executive function, processing speed, attention, mood, and cardiorespiratory fitness. Discussion and Implications There is preliminary evidence to support the positive effects of multicomponent interventions to improve cognitive-motor abilities in older adults at risk of developing dementia. The strength of this research evidence is, however, limited. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether these effects are maintained over time. The optimal intervention intensity and length also need to be established.

T1  - How Effective Are Dementia Caregiver Interventions? An Updated Comprehensive Meta-Analysis
AN  - 2464404172
AB  - Background and Objectives Caring for a person with dementia places a significant burden upon informal caregivers and leads to decreased psychological and physical health, which is why dementia caregiver interventions have been developed. However, empirical evidence for the efficacy of those interventions is inconclusive and the last comprehensive meta-analysis (Pinquart & Sörensen. Helping caregivers of persons with dementia: Which interventions work and how large are their effects? International Psychogeriatrics. 2006;18(4), 577–595.) was published more than 10 years ago. Research Design and Method This meta-analysis aims to update the meta-analysis conducted by Pinquart and Sörensen. Based on a systematic search in electronic data bases, effects of 282 controlled studies were integrated. The effectiveness of different intervention types and influences of study characteristics were evaluated. Results Interventions had, on average, a significant, small-to-moderate effect on the improvement of ability/knowledge, subjective well-being, burden, depression, and the caregiver's anxiety as well as symptoms of the care recipient. No mean effect was found in regard to reducing the risk of institutionalization. Most intervention types had an effect on the reduction of burden as well as on other outcomes. Psychoeducation and multicomponent interventions affected most outcomes, whereas the efficacy of other intervention types was domain-specific. Discussion and Implications There is evidence for the efficacy of dementia caregiver interventions, though due to having predominantly small effect sizes, there is still room for improvement. Interventions should be tailored to the desired outcome. More research on long-term effects, effects on anxiety and institutionalization, efficacy of respite and support interventions, care recipient training, and the intervention process is needed.

T1  - Home-Based Physical Activity Programs for People With Dementia: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
AN  - 2464403972
AB  - Background and Objectives Physical activity has the potential to improve health outcomes in people with dementia, namely when living at home. However, the knowledge about home-based physical activity for this population is scarce. Thus, we aim to identify and synthesize the effects of home-based physical activity for people with dementia. Research Design and Methods A systematic review was conducted. Quality of studies was assessed using the Delphi List. Effect sizes (ES) were calculated with MetaXL 2.0. A meta-analysis was conducted for the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Group Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL), Functional Reach test, Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, Short Physical Performance Battery, Dementia Quality of Life, NPI Caregivers subscale and Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Results Sixteen randomized controlled trials were included. Most were of high quality and published after 2015. A large heterogeneity of interventions was found. Meta-analysis showed significant results in MMSE (ES = 0.71, 95% CI 0.43, 0.99), NPI (ES = −0.37, 95% CI −0.57, −0.17), ADCS-ADL (ES = 0.80, 95% CI 0.53, 1.07), Functional Reach test (ES = 2.24, 95% CI 1.80, 2.68), TUG test (ES = −2.40, 95% CI −2.84, −1.96), NPI Caregivers subscale (ES = −0.63, 95% CI −0.94, −0.32), and ZBI (ES = −0.45, 95% CI −0.77, −0.13). Few minor adverse events and high adherence to intervention were found. Discussion and Implications Home-based physical activity seems safe and effective in delaying cognitive function decline and improving changes in behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, activities of daily living, health-related physical fitness, and carer's burden in people with dementia living at home.

T1  - No Other Safe Care Option: Nursing Home Admission as a Last Resort Strategy
AN  - 2464403955
AB  - Background and Objectives Nursing homes are intended for older adults with the highest care needs. However, approximately 12% of all nursing home residents have similar care needs as older adults who live in the community and the reasons they are admitted to nursing homes is largely unstudied. The purpose of this study was to explore the reasons why lower-care nursing home residents are living in nursing homes. Research Design and Methods A qualitative interpretive description methodology was used to gather and analyze data describing lower-care nursing home resident and family member perspectives regarding factors influencing nursing home admission, including the facilitators and barriers to living in a community setting. Data were collected via semistructured interviews and field notes. Data were coded and sorted, and patterns were identified. This resulted in themes describing this experience. Results The main problem experienced by lower-care residents was living alone in the community. Residents and family members used many strategies to avoid safety crises in the community but experienced multiple care breakdowns in both community and health care settings. Nursing home admission was a strategy used to avoid a crisis when residents did not receive the needed support to remain in the community. Discussion and Implications To successfully remain in the community, older adults require specialized supports targeting mental health and substance use needs, as well as enhanced hospital discharge plans and improved information about community-based care options. Implications involve reforming policies and practices in both hospital and community-based care settings.

T1  - Patterns and Predictors of Transitions Across Residential Care Settings and Nursing Homes Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults in the United States
AN  - 2464403741
AB  - Background and Objectives Older adults prefer to age in place, but sociodemographic, health, and socioeconomic factors may influence their decision to remain in the community. Guided by Andersen's behavioral model, we characterize incident transitions out of the community into residential care settings or nursing homes and identify predictors of these transitions. Research Design and Methods Study participants include 2,725 (weighted n = 13,704,390) community-dwelling U.S. older adults of the National Health and Aging Trends Study from 2011 to 2018. We examined the associations between sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and health factors and the probability of transition using a multinomial logit model. Results Over the study period, 86.2% of older adults remained in the community, whereas 9.0% and 4.9% transitioned to residential care settings and nursing homes, respectively. Older age, living alone, having functional and cognitive limitations, and hospitalization were associated with increased risk of transitioning to residential care settings or nursing homes from the community. Blacks and Hispanics were less likely to transition to residential care settings or nursing homes. Adults with lower income had a greater risk of transitioning to nursing homes. Medicaid enrollment did not affect the likelihood of transition. Discussion and Implications Majority of older adults remained in the community, and incident transition to residential care settings was more common than to nursing homes. Policy should target sociodemographic, health, and socioeconomic factors that enable older adults to age in place. Future work should examine whether these new residential care settings enhance the quality of life or result in subsequent transitions back into the community.

T1  - The Effects of Housing Cost Burden and Housing Tenure on Moves to a Nursing Home Among Low- and Moderate-Income Older Adults
AN  - 2464403677
AB  - Background and Objectives In the United States, a growing number of older adults struggle to find affordable housing that can adapt to their changing needs. Research suggests that access to affordable housing is a significant barrier to reducing unnecessary nursing home admissions. This is the first empirical study we know of to examine whether housing cost burden (HCB) is associated with moves to nursing homes among older adults. Research Design and Methods Data include low- and moderate-income community-dwelling older adults (N = 3,403) from the nationally representative 2015 National Health and Aging Trends Study. HCB (≥30% of income spent on mortgage/rent) and housing tenure (owner/renter) are combined to create a 4-category housing typology. Multinomial logistic regression models test (a) if renters with HCB are most likely (compared with other housing types) to move to a nursing home over 3 years (2015–2018) and (b) if housing type interacts with health and functioning to predict moves to a nursing home. Results Across all models, renters with HCB had the greatest likelihood of moving to a nursing home. Moreover, self-rated health, physical capacity, and mental health were weaker predictors of nursing home moves for renters with HCB. Discussion and Implications Results suggest that older renters with HCB are most likely to experience unnecessary nursing home placement. The growing population of older renters experiencing HCB may not only signal a housing crisis, but may also challenge national efforts to shift long-term care away from nursing homes and toward community-based alternatives.

T1  - Neighborhood Experiences of People Over Age 50: Factor Structure and Validity of a Scale
AN  - 2464403648
AB  - Background and Objectives Various aspects of the neighborhood environment have been shown to correlate with older adults' health. Socio-ecological models of health posit that interventions in the living environment can influence population health. Yet, there are no scales to comprehensively measure older people's experiences of their neighborhoods especially in dense urban contexts. This study analyzes the psychometric properties and factor structure of a holistic measure of Older People's Neighborhood Experience (OpenX) to understand constituent factors of residential satisfaction and well-being in dense urban contexts. Research Design and Methods Participants were 1,011 community-dwelling older adults aged 50 and older in Singapore. Face-to-face interviews were conducted. Questions were drawn to measure physical and social aspects of the neighborhood as well as sociodemographic variables. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to obtain a shorter version; content validity, internal consistency, and external validity were assessed. Results The OpenX has a 4-dimensional structure, explaining 45.5% of the variance of neighborhood experience. They are communal affordance, embeddedness, environment pleasantness, and time outdoors. Good reliability and validity were found, including Cronbach's alpha of 0.827. The correlation between neighborhood experience and objectively measured proximity to parks and fitness corners approached significance (p = .082). Discussion and Implications The 16-item OpenX demonstrated good psychometric properties. With reference to the transdisciplinary neighborhood health framework, it is useful for assessing older adults' neighborhood environment, identifying neighborhoods for pilot population health interventions, and understanding how the neighborhood environment affects older adults' health.

T1  - Learning through Practice: How Can We Address Loneliness among Older People?
AN  - 2463950474
AB  - The rising incidence of loneliness and social isolation, especially among older people has increasingly been identified in research, practice and policy developments. These issues have become key concerns for public health and social care agendas. Although social isolation and loneliness are often conflated, they are not significantly correlated. The effects of loneliness and social isolation on physical, mental and emotional wellbeing are well documented. Addressing the causes and consequences of loneliness and social isolation is complex. This article outlines a practice example of a grassroots early intervention project seeking to alleviate loneliness and isolation in one community in Belfast, Northern Ireland. CLARE (Creative Local Action Responses and Engagement), a not for profit community interest company, provides a community-based response for isolated older people. The CLARE model encompasses community development worker roles and the skills of community social workers to support and grow community assets, including a vibrant volunteer base. CLARE demonstrates the effectiveness of a multi-dimensional model that addresses loneliness by encompassing three core areas of ‘foundation services’ as highlighted by the Campaign to End Loneliness. The strengths and challenges of these interventions, and their potential for addressing loneliness and social isolation are discussed.

T1  - Adverse childhood experiences and problematic media use: the roles of attachment and impulsivity
AN  - 2460970576
AB  - Research has found that childhood adversity is associated with numerous maladaptive outcomes, including insecure attachment, mental health challenges, and problematic media use. As attachment is a primary developmental process that can be affected by childhood adversity, insecure attachment may be one psychological mechanism through which childhood adversity is associated with problematic media use. Further, disturbances in the attachment relationship resulting from childhood adversity may be associated with increased impulsivity, a construct that has been connected with problematic media use. Using a sample of adults (n = 616), this study examined whether the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and problematic media use was mediated through (i) attachment anxiety, (ii) attachment avoidance, or (iii) both attachment dimensions operating in series with impulsivity. Results revealed that a history of adverse childhood experiences was significantly associated with more problematic media use. Both anxious and avoidant attachment dimensions independently mediated the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and problematic media use. Specifically, avoidant attachment was associated with less problematic media use, and anxious attachment was associated with more problematic media use. Avoidant attachment and impulsivity in series, as well as anxious attachment and impulsivity in series, both accounted for part of the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and problematic media use. Results suggest that attachment may influence media use both directly and indirectly. Implications are discussed.

T1  - Pandemic, social distancing, and social work education: students’ satisfaction with online education in Vietnam
AN  - 2458510254
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has tremendously impacted different aspects of public health and social life across countries. In Vietnam, state-wide social distancing mandate has shifted the traditional face-to-face learning to online learning for at least two months, which created significant challenges for both social work educators and students, given the fact that most social work courses require the practice and direct interaction components, and many students have limited access to technology resources. This study aims to assess the level of immediate satisfaction of Vietnamese social work students with online courses during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 186 undergraduate-level social work students in a national univeristy in Vietnam completed an online survey on Qualtrics. The results show that students faced multiple problems with their participation in online courses due to the Internet access quality, such as disrupted connection and low-quality sound. Although being unfamiliar with online learning, most students reported no major difficulty, and having support available for their online learning. Students’ level of satisfaction with face-to-face teaching was significantly higher than that of online teaching on all criteria. A long-term strategy is needed to improve interactive activities and practices when teaching social work online.

T1  - The use of digital technology at home during the COVID-19 outbreak:Views of social work students in Greece
AN  - 2458510208
AB  - This study aims to explore Greek social work students’ views on the use of digital technology during their stay at home due to the coronavirus lockdown. To do this, an online questionnaire was voluntarily completed by 550 students (89.64% female and 9.82% male) from different university departments of social work across the country. The study was carried out by the researchers from 21 April 2020 to 1 May 2020. The results presented here describe aspects of using digital technology and its connections to learning interactions, communication with others, self-fulfilment and well-being. Also, they describe aspects of support either providing or receiving assistance as forms of solidarity and voluntarism during the COVID-19 confinement period. Overall, the results highlight the critical role digital technology played in numerous aspects of the daily lives of students, helping them to discover new ways to navigate the unprecedented new reality formed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

T1  - Addressing competency requirements of social work students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia
AN  - 2458510112
AB  - COVID-19 resulted in massive disruption and changes in every aspect of our lives. To curb the spread of the virus, many governments limited the movement of people or imposed full ‘lockdowns’. This created significant challenges for social workers practising with people often reliant on interpersonal support such as those at risk of domestic abuse; with mental health problems or learning disabilities. Measures to reduce viral spread affected the education sector at all levels from pre-school to higher education, disrupted traditional classroom pedagogy and shifted to technologically supported e-learning to minimise disruption to the students’ education. In lockdown, online teaching has become the new norm. E-learning has its limitations for professional curricula such as social work. Like most countries, field practice represents a compulsory component of the social work curriculum in Malaysia which measures the capabilities or competency of students to enable them to become qualified social workers. When COVID-19 forced universities and agencies to halt field placements in Malaysia, the immediate challenge was to find alternative ways of assessing students. This paper aims to provide an overview of field education assessment in Malaysia during the pandemic and to pose questions for future assessment as Malaysian social work drives towards increased professional regulation.

T1  - The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social work education and practice in the Netherlands
AN  - 2458510020
AB  - During the first half of 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus had a huge global impact. The physical health of many was (often severely) threatened and affected, resulting in numerous deaths. Furthermore, all aspects of human coexistence came under pressure, such as economic activities and material living conditions, psychological well-being and social contacts, human rights and democratic decision-making, international political relations and global solidarity. As in other parts of the world, COVID-19 kept the Netherlands in its grip.In this article we would like to address the following questions:-What impact did pandemic and policy have on Dutch social work education and how was this experienced by students?-What was the impact of pandemic and policy on social work practices and what were its challenges for social professionals?-What does this all mean for the future of social work education, since it has to take the present concerns of students into account as well as prepare them for social work practice in the near future?

T1  - The Critical Cycle of Mixtape Creation: Reducing Stress via Three Different Group Counseling Styles
AN  - 2457544197
AB  - While significant attention has been given to student learning loss across summer, much less attention is given to student stressors and mental health concerns. To assist youth in processing and coping with emotional stress, research explores approaches to group counseling wherein youth write, record, and perform emotionally themed hip hop mixtapes. Hip hop, counseling, and social work literature lack studies comparing the effectiveness of different group types. This study examined a hip hop integrated therapeutic model within three groups using distinct leadership styles; within a high school summer enrichment program. Results suggest statistically significant reductions in stress and depressive levels.

T1  - Determinants of Sleep Medication Use among Participants in the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set
AN  - 2457237017
AB  - Sufficient sleep is critical for health in older adults, but prescription sleep aids are associated with numerous health risks (e.g., cognitive impairment and falls). We examine usage prevalence of two medication categories—sedative hypnotics (SH) and medications commonly used for insomnia (MCUFI)—among adults aged 45+ in the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center data set. Analyzing the visits conducted between September 2005 and June 2018, we determine the factors associated with SH and MCUFI use, including sociodemographic, health, independence, and cognitive statuses. Usage rates were 9% for MCUFI (N = 3,279) and 4% for SH (N = 1,382). Multivariable logistic regression identified White race, higher education, younger age, depression, and sedative polypharmacy as factors associated with prescription sleep aid use. We conclude that sleep medication usage rates among older adults, higher likelihood of sedative medication polypharmacy, and higher likelihood of MCUFI use among adults with cognitive impairment are findings of concern and may warrant clinical intervention.

T1  - Nature of Retirement and Loneliness: The Moderating Roles of Social Support
AN  - 2457236858
AB  - Drawing from the social convoy model, this study investigates whether the nature of retirement (voluntary or involuntary) influences loneliness among retirees, and how different social support types may affect this association. Data come from the 2014 Health and Retirement Study (N = 2,055). Five social support types were identified: weak, ambivalent, strong positive, children strain, and family strain. Involuntary retirement was associated with a higher level of loneliness; however, involuntarily retired individuals with strong positive social support had a relatively lower level of loneliness. Findings from this study suggest that social support may alleviate the negative impacts of involuntary retirement. Our research provides a theoretical basis for developing a practical program to reduce the negative impacts of involuntary retirement on well-being.

T1  - Social Participation and Health Outcomes Among Caregivers and Noncaregivers in Great Britain
AN  - 2457236760
AB  - This study investigates the relationship between social participation and health outcomes between caregivers and noncaregivers in Great Britain. Previous studies indicate that the impact of informal caregiving on the carer’s health is complex, and the intensity of care provision has an adverse impact on the caregivers’ health, while social participation could have a protective role in this respect. Using qualitative and quantitative data from Wave 8 of the 1958 National Child Development Study, the analysis shows that social participation has a positive effect on the carers’ mental health and subjective well-being. Individuals who did not engage in social participation reported lower levels of mental health and control, autonomy, self-realization and pleasure (CASP) scores than those engaged in social participation. The qualitative results showed the barriers to social participation of caregivers to be time, energy, and finance. We discuss ways in which the government could address such barriers to improve the level of social participation among caregivers.

T1  - Resident Preferences and CNA Empowerment: Testing Validity and Reliability of a Culture Change Survey Tool
AN  - 2457236365
AB  - Culture change (CC) is an innovation to improve nursing home resident quality of life. Inconsistencies in how CC is measured make the interpretation of findings inconclusive. The purpose of this study is to determine the underlying factors of CC among Ohio nursing homes to extract the core essence of CC. Data from the 2015 Ohio Biennial Survey of Long-Term Care Facilities with n = 721 nursing homes answering a CC module comprising of 21 questions are included in an exploratory factor analysis (EFA). EFA results identified two underlying factors of CC that are extracted using principal factor method. These factors include items related to resident preferences for care (RPC) and certified nursing assistant (CNA) empowerment. This study presents two valid and reliable scales to advance the measurement of CC. These scales can be used to explore both RPC and CNA empowerment components as predictors or outcomes.

T1  - “It’s What’s on the Inside That Counts”: A Pilot Study of the Subjective Changes among Returned Citizens Participating in a Peer-Mentor Support Initiative
AN  - 2449828627
AB  - Peer mentorship programs with returned citizens (i.e., formally incarcerated) have recently emerged as a model that provides mentees and mentors with opportunities to practice new roles that broaden their self-identity and consequently can also assist with maintaining ongoing, non-recidivating behavior. Yet, few evidence-based models focus directly on supporting the peer mentor’s identity change process. This study employed a pretest–posttest evaluation of a pilot six-week training program, the Credible Messengers Institute, designed to support subjective factors that strengthen the self-identity change process among returning citizens (N = 35) who are mentoring adjudicated youth. Findings revealed a statistically significant improvement in subjective factors, including, self-esteem, level of hope, and elements of self-identity change behaviors (self-knowledge; self-awareness and self-reflection; self-care) from pretest to posttest. The issue of developing the self-identity of returned citizens contributes to a wider discussion on the challenges and recent trends in the development of post-incarceration services and supports. Future research should replicate this pilot study with additional participants and rigorous research methodologies to further substantiate the subjective changes among peer mentors.

T1  - An Exploratory Study of Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAI) in Social Service Agencies
AN  - 2449826453
AB  - This exploratory survey of social service professionals investigated the use of animal-assisted interventions (AAI) within various occupations and settings. Forty one participants from social service agencies responded to an electronic survey. Sixty eight percent of respondents indicated they are providing AAI with the most common type being animal-assisted activities (AAA). Forty one percent of respondents indicated they have received some training in AAI with hospital and residential treatment settings having the most training. Individuals with mental illness and physical disabilities are the largest groups receiving AAI. Many benefits were noted with the implementation of AAI including increased social interaction, decreased stress and decreased depression. The most commonly cited barrier to implementation of AAI was liability concerns. Future research detailing how social service agencies overcame barriers would be valuable for others who wish to implement AAI.

T1  - Challenges and Rewards of Social Work Pioneers in the “Making” Process: A Qualitative Study
AN  - 2449826433
AB  - This article reports on the findings from individual interviews with 20 social worker pioneers who have more than ten years of experience in social work and have been recognized as leaders in the profession. The term “making” in the paper’s title refers to the intervention of the Chinese government, which has been crucial and has gradually “made” social work into a profession. The interview transcripts were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis, which revealed that the social worker pioneers’ ten years of experience in social work affected many aspects of their lives. Three major themes were identified in their experiences. Social worker pioneers faced various challenges over ten years; however, they still found satisfying work in their work environments, including discovering meaning and achieving personal accomplishments. This article offers insights into the experiences of social worker pioneers’ experiences in southern China. The study presents implications for future professional practice, especially in terms of social service practice and ongoing education to particular value to practitioners as well as mechanisms to support the work of social work professionals. The positive aspects of social service jobs may provide a rich area for future research and for the education of social work students.

T1  - Dimensions of Electronic Fraud and Governance of Trust in Nigeria’s Cashless Ecosystem
AN  - 2447816537
AB  - A negative outcome of the nascent cashless policy in Nigeria has been persistent electronic banking fraud (e-fraud). Fraud occurrence in any financial space indicates insecurity and loopholes being exploited by fraudsters. This underscores the importance of trust governance in electronic banking and its centrality in a transiting cashless economy like Nigeria. Against this background, we investigated e-banking fraud and the role trust governance plays in both the adoption and refusal to migrate and use electronic banking in Nigeria. Using qualitative methods (in-depth and key informant interviews) of data collection, 30 participants were purposively selected and in some instances reached through the snowball and referral methods. Findings showed internal, external, and collaborative dimensions of e-fraud. Experiences of fraud reportedly affected adoption and migration of bank customers to e-banking platforms. Although weak governance mechanism was reported, banks nonetheless are embracing security mechanisms such as sending SCAM alert messages to customers, while shaming and sack of compromised staff were employed as within-bank measures to secure the confidence of customers in the evolving financial ecosystem.

T1  - Health Capability and Psychological Effects of Regular Exercise on Adults: Middle-Aged and Older
AN  - 2447808764
AB  - This study sought to determine whether there is any difference on participation in regular exercise between middle-aged and older adults and to determine whether the benefits of regular exercise differed between middle-aged and older adults in terms of health capability, mood, or anxiety symptoms and life-satisfaction level. The results indicated that older adults engaged in regular exercise more frequently than middle-aged adults. In addition, exercise participants among middle-aged adults had the better health capabilities, lower depression and anxiety symptoms, and higher life-satisfaction level than nonparticipants. On the other hands, older adults tended to be negatively associated with depression and anxiety symptoms and be positively correlated with life-satisfaction level than middle-aged adults even if middle-aged adults had the better health capabilities. These findings might be beneficial to provide appropriate exercise programs, to prevent and minimize the negative symptoms of anxiety and depression, and to facilitate the life-satisfaction level.

T1  - A Matter of Life and Death: Teaching Undergraduates About the End of Life
AN  - 2447808645
AB  - As the population ages, the number of careers that intersect with aging is expected to grow. However, many young people lack an interest in working with aging populations. As previous work has shown, though, students’ interest in aging careers may be stimulated by coursework and experiential activities related to aging. Despite being a normative developmental process, anxiety about death and dying may be particular barriers to students developing interest in aging, and these topics may be particularly difficult subjects to teach in the college classroom. Here, strategies and activities for teaching the end of life are offered.

T1  - Longitudinal Stress-Buffering Effects of Social Integration for Late-Life Functional Health
AN  - 2447808363
AB  - Stress can negatively affect multiple aspects of health, including functional health, among older adults, who are likely to face unique, age-related stressful experiences. Previous research has addressed the protective effects of social relations (i.e., social ties, social participation, and social integration) for physical and mental health outcomes, yet few studies have examined functional health. This study aimed to investigate the longitudinal stress-buffering effects of social integration on late-life functional health. Using three-wave data from 399 older adults (aged older than 60 years), two-level hierarchical linear modeling analysis was conducted and the results indicated that in addition to its main effect on functional (activity of daily living) limitations, social integration moderated the negative effect of stress on the longitudinal trajectory of functional limitations. The findings suggest important directions of future research to identify the mechanisms of such buffering effects over time and develop effective interventions to enhance late-life functional health while promoting social integration.

T1  - When I’m 75: College Students’ Self Perceptions of the Challenges of Aging
AN  - 2447808252
AB  - Despite robust literature on people’s attitudes toward aging, far less is known about attitudes toward one’s own aging, especially among college students. We examined college students’ self-perceptions of the challenges of aging using essays from a “When I’m 75” assignment implemented at the beginning and end of the semester in an introductory gerontology course. Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis was used to analyze 24 students’ perceptions of their own aging at age 75. The superordinate theme, challenges of aging, was identified along with five subordinate themes: deterioration, age-related impairments, mental health, loneliness and loss, and experiencing ageism. Findings suggest that after completing the course, students both demonstrated an understanding of realistic age-related changes and had (contradictory) stereotypical ideas of what it would be like to be 75. Findings have implications for research that continues to evaluate self-perceptions and contributes to the development of pedagogical strategies and tools that promote students’ optimal aging.

T1  - Subjective Age in Older Korean Americans: The Impact of Functional Disability Mediated by Attitudes Toward Aging
AN  - 2447808047
AB  - The present study aims to examine how subjective age of older Korean Americans would be affected by functional disability and attitudes toward aging. We hypothesized that (a) both functional disability and attitudes toward aging would have a direct effect on subjective age and (b) the effect of functional disability on subjective age would be mediated by attitudes toward aging. Our analyses of the survey data with 208 community-dwelling Korean Americans aged 60 and older (mean age = 69.6, SD = 7.51) showed that the indirect effect of functional disability on subjective age through attitudes toward aging [–.020 (.009)] was significant (bias-corrected 95% confidence interval [–.039, –.006]). The findings suggest that functional disability fosters negative attitudes toward aging, which in turn leads to the feelings of being older than actual age. Our study suggests ways to preserve and promote positive perceptions of age and aging.

T1  - An Association Between Perceived Social Support and Posttraumatic Stress Symptom Severity Among Women With Lifetime Sexual Victimization: The Serial Mediating Role of Resilience and Coping
AN  - 2447807148
AB  - This study examined the association between perceived social support and severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms, serially mediated by resilience and coping among women exposed to different patterns of sexual victimization experiences: childhood sexual abuse (CSA) only, adult sexual assault (ASA) only, and sexual revictimization (SR). A total of 255 sexually victimized women recruited from four U.S. universities completed self-report measures online; 112 participants reported provisionally diagnosable levels of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The proposed model was largely supported in the CSA only group and the SR group. Different patterns of mediational effects were found across the three groups. Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed.

T1  - African American Sexual Assault Survivors and Mental Health Help-Seeking: A Mixed Methods Study
AN  - 2447807046
AB  - Little research has focused on African American women’s sexual assault victimization and mental health seeking. A mixed methods study was conducted to explore African American women’s sexual assault in relationship to mental health seeking and experiences with mental health providers in a large community sample. Quantitative survey and qualitative interview data indicated unique correlates of immediate and longer term seeking of help from various mental health sources. Barriers and facilitators of African American women’s mental health seeking were identified and qualitative themes were uncovered relevant to this group of survivors. Implications for research and clinical practice with this population are provided.

T1  - Do Negative Emotional States Play a Role in the Association Between Intimate Partner Violence and Poor Health-Related Quality of Life in Chinese Women From Low-Income Families?
AN  - 2447806894
AB  - A cross-sectional analysis of a dataset of 156 participants in a health assessment program explored whether negative emotional states mediated the association between intimate partner violence (IPV) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Compared with IPV screen-negative participants, those who screened positive had significantly lower HRQoL and significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. The inverse associations between the presence of IPV and HRQoL were found to be mediated by depression, anxiety, and stress. Therefore, interventions to alleviate negative emotions in women suffering from IPV have the potential to be useful in improving their HRQoL.

T1  - Sexual Assault Survivors’ Post-Traumatic Growth: Individual and Community-Level Differences
AN  - 2447806883
AB  - Past research has focused on individual differences in post-traumatic growth (PTG) among survivors, but no studies to date have examined differences at the neighborhood level. This exploratory study uses data from a 3-year longitudinal study of women sexual assault survivors (N = 1,863) living in a segregated city. We tested random intercept models of individuals nested within neighborhoods. Disrupted core beliefs, greater perceived control over recovery, less post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), religious coping, and positive social coping predicted more PTG. White survivors had lower PTG scores than the women of color in this study. Neighborhood-level differences in PTG scores persisted even though violent crime rate and neighborhood poverty did not emerge as significant in our model.

T1  - Traumatic Experience, Polytraumatization, and Perinatal Depression in a Diverse Sample of Adolescent Mothers
AN  - 2436792585
AB  - This study examines the prevalence of trauma subtypes, polytraumatization, and perinatal depression (PND) in a diverse sample of adolescent mothers to help inform PND prevention, screening, and treatment efforts. We conducted a secondary analysis of a sample (N = 210) of adolescent mothers aged 14 to 20 years from a prospective longitudinal study of PND. Participants were recruited from a county-based, public health prenatal clinic, and data were collected in the prenatal and postpartum periods. In this sample, 81% of adolescent mothers reported at least one trauma experience and 75% reported lifetime experience of intimate partner violence (IPV). The most prevalent trauma types among adolescent mothers reporting PND were sexual trauma prior to age 13 (11.9%), loss of a caregiver or sibling (28.3%), emotional adversity (17.1%), and polytraumatization (43%). Trauma is alarmingly prevalent among adolescent mothers. Results suggest standards of care for adolescent mothers should include screening adolescent mothers for trauma history and provision of appropriate referrals for IPV. Findings support the need for trauma-informed treatment in perinatal public health clinics to decrease potential health risks to both mother and baby.

T1  - Domestic Violence as a Risk Factor for Attempted Suicide in Married Women
AN  - 2436792445
AB  - High rates of suicide attempts and domestic violence (DV) in women of reproductive age group have been reported from South India, but the association between them was not studied. Hence, this study was undertaken to assess whether DV is a risk factor for attempted suicide in married women of reproductive age group. A hospital-based case-control study with 77 incident cases of attempted suicide in married women of the age group of 18 to 45 years and 153 controls belonging to the same age group, without history of suicide attempt, was undertaken over a period of 6 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done. The crude odds ratio (cOR) for DV was found to be 6.15 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = [2.95, 12.82], p value = .0001). Other statistically significant risk factors included younger age group (below 30 years); gross family income > Rs. 5,000; higher occupational status of spouse; having poor social support; having a family history of psychiatric disorders, substance use disorders, and suicide/suicide attempt; higher impulsiveness scores; having higher scores of stressful life events over the past 12 months, and alcohol use disorder in husband. Islamic faith was found to be a significant protective factor. On logistic regression, DV was found to be an independent risk factor for attempted suicide in this study population (adjusted OR = 3.79, 95% CI = [1.35, 10.62], p value = .011). Age groups, stressful life events, impulsiveness, and alcohol use disorder in husband were the confounders adjusted for in logistic regression along with other significant risk and protective factors. Significant dose–response relationship was also observed between DV and attempted suicide. In accordance with the stress-diathesis model for suicidal behavior, DV is found to be a stressor which precipitates suicide attempt in those with diathesis like family history of psychiatric disorders. Clinical, research, and policy implications of the findings are discussed.

T1  - Memories of Boys, Girls, and Adolescent Victims of Political Prison and Torture by the Chilean Military–Civilian Dictatorship
AN  - 2436792418
AB  - This article reconstructs and analyzes the memories of victims of political prison and torture during the Chilean Military–Civilian Dictatorship who were minors when they experienced this violence. Participants in the study were 11 adults, six women and five men from the region of Valparaíso, who were victims of State terrorism during childhood and adolescence. The information production technique used was the focus group. A textual analysis was performed, based on interdisciplinary contributions from interpretation theory and discourse theories. The analysis of the information identified distinctive elements in the traumatic memories according to the sex-gender system associated with the private/public and passivity/agency dimensions. The results of this study reveal the urgent need to recognize boys, girls, and adolescents as people with rights who should be protected by both adults and States. Moreover, these results emphasize the need to implement early intervention programs in people affected by psychosocial traumas and disasters of different types, and improve their quality of life.

T1  - “How Many Silences Are There?” Men’s Experience of Victimization in Intimate Partner Relationships
AN  - 2436792374
AB  - There is a substantive body of research focusing on women’s experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV), but a lack of qualitative studies focusing on men’s experiences as victims of IPV. This article addresses this gap in the literature by paying particular attention to hegemonic masculinities and men’s perceptions of IPV. Men (N = 9) participated in in-depth interviews. Interview data were rigorously subjected to thematic analysis, which revealed five key themes in the men’s narratives: fear of IPV, maintaining power and control, victimization as a forbidden narrative, critical understanding of IPV, and breaking the silence. Although the men share similar stories of victimization as women, the way this is influenced by their gendered histories is different. While some men reveal a willingness to disclose their victimization and share similar fear to women victims, others reframe their victim status in a way that sustains their own power and control. The men also draw attention to the contextual realities that frame abuse, including histories of violence against the women who used violence and the realities of communities suffering intergenerational affects of colonized histories. The findings reinforce the importance of in-depth qualitative work toward revealing the context of violence, understanding the impact of fear, victimization, and power/control on men’s mental health as well as the outcome of legal and support services and lack thereof. A critical discussion regarding the gendered context of violence, power within relationships, and addressing men’s need for support without redefining victimization or taking away from policies and support for women’s ongoing victimization concludes the work.

T1  - The Role of Violent Thinking in Violent Behavior: It’s More About Thinking Than Drinking
AN  - 2436792336
AB  - This article aims to explore and report on violent thinking and alcohol misuse; how these factors may predict self-reported violence. The role of violent thinking in violent behavior is both well established in theoretical models, yet there are few measures that explain this role. One measure that has been identified is the Maudsley Violence Questionnaire (MVQ). This is the first study to explore the use of the MVQ with a general (nonoffender) adult sample, having already been shown to be valid with young people (under 18 years old), adult male offenders, and mentally disordered offenders. This study involved 808 adult participants—569 female and 239 male participants. As figures demonstrate that around half of all violent crime in the United Kingdom is alcohol related, we also explored the role of alcohol misuse. Regression was used to explore how these factors predicted violence. The results demonstrate the important role of violent thinking in violent behavior. The MVQ factor of “Machismo” was the primary factor in regression models for both male and female self-reported violence. The role of alcohol in the regression models differed slightly between the male and female participants, with alcohol misuse involved in male violence. The study supports theoretical models including the role of violent thinking and encourages those hoping to address violence, to consider “Machismo” as a treatment target. The study also provides further validation of the MVQ as a helpful tool for clinicians or researchers who may be interested in “measuring” violent thinking.

T1  - A Quantitative Study on Gender Differences in Disclosing Child Sexual Abuse and Reasons for Nondisclosure
AN  - 2436792329
AB  - Despite the available literature on disclosure of child sexual abuse (CSA), little is known about how gender affects disclosure. This article aims to quantitatively examine whether gender differences exist in formal (to legal or child protection authorities) and informal (to a family member or friend) disclosure of CSA and, if so, to assess whether this relation is associated with abuse characteristics and attitudes toward gender roles. The study also aimed to examine whether gender differences exist in reasons not to disclose CSA. Data of a sample of 586 participants, who reported to have experienced CSA committed by a single person, have been used for the analyses. There were no gender differences for formal disclosure, but the informal disclosure rate of CSA was 2.4 times higher for women than men, and this effect remained significant after controlling for abuse characteristics and attitudes, even though the gender difference decreased slightly. Furthermore, women and men reported different reasons for not disclosing CSA in their personal network. Women were more worried than men that family and friends would discover the abuse and reported more insecurity of what to do in this situation. Professionals in the field of CSA should consider a gender perspective when developing guidelines. Men have rarely been the subject of studies of disclosure after CSA. Professionals should focus more on general mental health outcomes of men that are not related with CSA directly, but where the effects of CSA may exert more indirectly through associations with other problems in life.

T1  - The Association Between Intimate Partner Violence and Signs of Depression During Pregnancy in Kilimanjaro Region, Northern Tanzania
AN  - 2436792275
AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) against pregnant women is common with severe health consequences to women and their babies. The aim of the present study is to measure the association between IPV and signs of depression among pregnant women attending antenatal care in a semi-urban setting in northern Tanzania. A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 1, 2014, to May 30, 2015, among pregnant women attending routine antenatal care in Moshi Municipality, Tanzania. During their third trimester, self-reported exposure to IPV was assessed using a validated structured questionnaire adopted from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Multi-Country Study on Women’s Health and Domestic Violence. Signs of depression were assessed using Edinburg Postpartum Depression Scale. A total of 1,116 pregnant women were included in the analysis. A total number of 433 (38.8%) reported to be exposed to at least one type of violence during their pregnancy, and 128 (11.5%) presented with signs of depression. The most common type of violence experienced was emotional violence (30.7%), followed by sexual violence (19.0%) and physical violence (10.0%). Exposure to at least one type of violence was the strongest predictor for depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [3.25, 7.86]), followed by women who reported their primary source of emotional support was individuals not related to their family as compared with support obtained from their male partner/husband (AOR = 2.25; 95% CI = [1.26, 4.02]). Positive HIV/AIDS status (AOR = 2.27; 95% CI = [1.01, 5.14]) and previous history of depression (AOR = 1.62; 95% CI = [1.00, 2.64]). After adjusting for other predictors and types of violence, physical violence was the strongest predictor for signs of depression (AOR = 4.42; 95% CI = [2.65, 7.37]). Signs of depression were commonly observed among pregnant women and strongly associated with exposure to any type of IPV. The present findings indicate an urgent need for screening depression and IPV to mitigate the adverse health outcomes related to both IPV and depression during pregnancy.

T1  - An Analysis of Help-Seeking Patterns Among College Student Victims of Sexual Assault, Dating Violence, and Stalking
AN  - 2436792251
AB  - Despite the negative outcomes associated with sexual assault (SA), dating violence (DV), and stalking victimization, many victims, particularly college students, do not seek help for these crimes. To date, the majority of help-seeking research has focused on one form of victimization, despite substantial evidence that many victims experience more than one form of interpersonal violence. In addition to consideration of such polyvictims, intervention efforts to increase help-seeking to improve victim outcomes may benefit from a clearer understanding of overlapping predictors of help-seeking across victimization types. Using the health belief model (HBM) as a guiding framework, the current study examined predictors of help-seeking for SA, DV, and stalking in a college student sample. Data were collected via a multiyear anonymous email survey of general health and well-being. Demographic predictors of help-seeking and severity indicators informed by the HBM were evaluated across violence types. In addition to replicating previous work, results provided support for the HBM, such that a number of severity indicators, particularly those representing overlap across victimization types, predicted help-seeking at the multivariate level. Results also provide new evidence for overlap of barriers to help-seeking across violence types, with victim’s belief that the incident was not serious enough the most commonly reported reason for not seeking help across all three types of victimization. This overlap may provide opportunities for consolidating prevention and intervention efforts across victimization types.

T1  - Longitudinal Effects of Gendered Harassment Perpetration and Victimization on Mental Health Outcomes in Adolescence
AN  - 2436792250
AB  - Gendered harassment, including sexual harassment and homophobic name-calling, is prevalent in adolescents and is linked to negative outcomes including depression, anxiety, suicidality, substance abuse, and personal distress. However, much of the extant literature is cross-sectional and rarely are perpetrators of these behaviors included in studies of outcomes. Therefore, the current study examined the effects of longitudinal changes in gendered harassment perpetration and victimization on changes in mental health outcomes among a large sample of early adolescents. Given that these behaviors commonly occur in the context of a patriarchal society (males hold power), we also investigated the impact of gender on gendered harassment. Participants included 3,549 students from four Midwestern middle schools (50.4% female, 49% African American, 34% White) at two time points (13 and 17 years old). Results indicated that increases from age 13 to 17 years in sexual harassment perpetration and victimization and homophobic name-calling perpetration and victimization predicted increases in depression symptoms and substance use. Gender did not moderate these pathways. These findings highlight that negative outcomes are associated with changes in gendered harassment among adolescents and emphasize the importance of prevention efforts. Implications for school interventions are discussed.

T1  - Types of Trauma and Self-Reported Pain That Limits Functioning in Different-Aged Cohorts
AN  - 2436792221
AB  - There is a growing body of literature that childhood or adult trauma exposure can have lifelong mental and physical health impacts. In this large cross-sectional analysis, authors investigated combinations of trauma types and pain resulting in functional limitations among women recruited into a statewide health registry. Combinations of traumas such as child physical abuse (CPA), child sexual abuse (CSA), and adult violence were hypothesized to be associated with greater likelihood of limiting pain and earlier symptom onset, relative to women with no or singular trauma exposures. Pain prevalence rates (PRs) and adjusted prevalence rate ratios (aPRRs) were highest among women experiencing multiple forms of violence (43.3% among women disclosing CPA, CSA, and adult violence; aPRR = 2.06, p < .001), intermediate for women experiencing CPA or CSA yet no adult violence (37.0%; aPRR = 1.76, p < .001), and lower among women experiencing adult violence only (27.1%; aPRR = 1.29, p < .001), relative to women never experiencing violence (20.7%). As hypothesized, the effect of combinations of trauma on chronic pain was consistently greatest for those reporting limiting pain at younger ages. Implications include the need to identify combinations of traumatic events across the life span, and to intervene early to reduce the impact of trauma on health and functioning.

T1  - The Role of the Perceptions of School Climate and Teacher Victimization by Students
AN  - 2436792218
AB  - Violence directed toward teachers in schools is relatively understudied in comparison with other school-based forms of peer aggression (e.g., school bullying). Based on the nationally representative Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) 2011-2012, approximately 10% of K-12 public school teachers in the United States, received a threat in the past 12 months and 6% reported being physically attacked. The effects of teacher-directed violence are far reaching and affect not just the victimized teacher, but the larger community itself. In the current study, we used multilevel logistic regression models with state fixed effects to analyze the SASS data set. The analytic sample consisted of 24,070 K-12 teachers in 4,610 public schools and specifically excluded special education teachers and teachers in alternative settings (i.e., online schools, special education centers, juvenile correction facilities). Guided by authoritative school climate theory, we tested for the beneficial associations of disciplinary structure and administrative support with the reduced likelihood of a teacher being threatened or physically attacked by a student, while controlling for teacher (e.g., gender, years of experience, race/ethnicity), school (e.g., school size, percent minority enrollment), and state-level factors. Results indicated that teachers who felt supported by the administration and worked with others (i.e., the principal and other teachers) who enforced the rules consistently were less likely to be victims of threats of injury or physical attacks. Although school climate has been shown to have a positive effect on student outcomes, the current study also suggests that school climate, characterized by consistent rule enforcement and supportive administrators and teachers, may play a role in reducing the likelihood of teacher victimization.

T1  - An Analysis of the Relationship Between High School Students’ Tendency Toward Violence, Self-Esteem, and Competitive Attitude
AN  - 2436792194
AB  - This study analyzes the relationship among high school students’ tendencies toward violence, self-esteem, and competitive attitudes. It was conducted in Fethiye, Muğla, between September 2013 and January 2014. The population of the study consisted of 6,531 students from 11 high schools. The participants were determined using stratified random sampling, and the study data were collected from 1,600 students. A personal information form, the Violence Tendency Scale, the Competitive Attitude Scale, and the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Scale were used as data collection tools. In this study, the rate of the participants who were exposed to violence was 15.4%. Of them, 46.2% said that one of their family members was violent toward them, while 27.3% said that their teachers had been violent toward them. Of the participants that were exposed to violence, 55.8% reported psychological violence, 27.3% reported physical violence, and 10.8% reported sexual violence. In the study, tendency toward violence is a dependent variable, while competitive attitude and self-esteem are independent variables. Family type, exposure to violence, and demographics are control variables. Age, class, school, family attitude, and exposure to violence are the variables that created significant differences in the tendency for violence. The present study showed that there was an inverse and weak yet significant relationship between the students’ tendencies toward violence and competitiveness (r = −.169), and a positive and weak relationship between tendency toward violence and self-esteem (r = .238). Also, there was an inverse and low-level significant relationship between competitiveness and self-esteem (r = −.121). The variables which affect the tendency toward violence are gender, exposure to violence, competitiveness, age, self-esteem, and extended family type in a descending order regarding their importance. The predictive power of the variables on the tendency toward violence was 16.8%, which is not statistically significant.

T1  - Emancipated Foster Youth and Intimate Partner Violence: An Exploration of Risk and Protective Factors
AN  - 2436792172
AB  - Due to their high rates of parental maltreatment and violence exposure, youth in the foster care system are considered particularly vulnerable to experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) in adolescence and young adulthood. Those who have emancipated from foster care may be at a heightened risk, as they are significantly more likely to struggle in a variety of critical domains (i.e., mental health, substance use, and delinquency). This longitudinal study is the first to explore the impact of demographic, individual, family, and foster care system factors on IPV involvement for foster care alumni at age 23/24. Analyses were conducted on three waves of quantitative data from the Midwest Evaluation of the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth (the Midwest Study). We find that approximately 21% of the young adults in our sample were involved in some type of IPV at age 23/24, with bidirectional violence the most commonly reported form. Males were more likely than females to report IPV victimization, whereas females were more likely than males to report IPV perpetration and bidirectional violence. Young adults who reported parental IPV prior to foster care entry were more likely to be involved in bidirectionally violent partnerships than nonviolent partnerships in young adulthood, as were young adults who reported neglect by a foster caregiver and those who reported greater placement instability while in the foster care system. Anxiety at baseline increased the odds of IPV perpetration at age 23/24, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at baseline decreased the odds of IPV perpetration at age 23/24. Understanding the characteristics and experiences that place these young adults at risk for IPV will allow for more effective and targeted prevention efforts.

T1  - Violent Discipline Behaviors in Mothers of Preschool Children in Malatya, East Anatolia
AN  - 2436792164
AB  - Violent parenting behavior, whether physical or psychological, give harms to child well-being. This study was conducted to describe and compare the prevalence of discipline methods used by mothers of 2- to 5-year-old children in Malatya, Turkey. This is a cross sectional study and 552 mothers were administered a face-to-face questionnaire describe the methods they use to discipline their children in the year previous the survey. It was observed that nine of 10 women used violence on their children physically and psychologically. The study showed that nine of 10 mothers used physical and/or psychological punishment toward their children in the previous year. Nonviolent discipline was less prevalent than punitive discipline, such as psychological and physical punishment. The most commonly used method was psychological punishment. Significant sociodemographic associations with discipline methods were found. Mother’s educational level, family income, child gender, and child age were the independent predictors that explained discipline methods used by mothers. Starting parenting classes and strengthening the child protection systems at national level were suggested.

T1  - Prior Interpersonal Violence Exposure and Experiences During and After a Disaster as Predictors of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Depression Among Adolescent Victims of the Spring 2011 Tornadoes
AN  - 2436792160
AB  - The purpose of the current report was to examine prior history of exposure to interpersonal violence (IPV), as compared with prior accident or prior disaster exposure, experiences during and after a disaster, and demographic variables as predictors of past month posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression severity among adolescents exposed to the tornadoes in Alabama and Missouri. IPV exposure has been consistently identified as a unique category of potentially traumatic events (PTE) that significantly increases risk for development of PTSD and other difficulties relative to other event types among adolescents. A population-based sample of adolescents and caregivers (N = 2,000) were recruited randomly from tornado-affected communities in Alabama and Joplin, Missouri. Participants completed structured telephone interviews on an average of 8.8 months posttornado. Prior history of IPV was prevalent (36.5%), as was reported history of accidents (25.9%) and prior disaster exposure (26.9%). Negative binomial regression analyses with PTSD and depression symptom counts for past month as outcome variables indicated that history of predisaster IPV was most robustly related to PTSD and depression symptoms, such that those with a history of IPV endorsed over 3 times the number of symptoms than those without IPV history. Final model statistics indicated that female gender, physical injury to caregiver, concern about others’ safety, prior disaster, prior accident, and prior IPV exposure were also related to PTSD. Predictors of depression symptoms were similar with the exception that concern about others’ safety was not a predictor and age was a predictor in the final model. It is important to evaluate potential additive effects of IPV history in addition to recent disaster exposure variables and to consider such history when developing interventions aimed to reduce or prevent symptoms of PTSD and depression among adolescents recently exposed to disaster.

T1  - Beyond the Force–Substance Dichotomy: Examining the Experience of Combined and Incapacitated Type Rapes and Their Relation to PTSD Symptoms
AN  - 2436792158
AB  - Prior research has examined how posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are influenced by the experience of different types of rape, defined according to the method of coercion used. This work, which classifies rape experiences as either forcible or substance-involved, has yielded mixed findings regarding differences in PTSD symptoms as a function of rape type. Based on recent evidence indicating significant heterogeneity within substance-involved rapes, the present study utilized a novel four-group conceptualization of rape type to examine differences in PTSD symptom severity and associated factors across rape type. Using a sample of 161 community women with experiences of adult rape, we examined four rape types based on method of coercion: forcible-only rape (i.e., involving only force/threat of force; n = 48), impaired rape (i.e., substance-related impairment was present, but the participant remained conscious; n = 56), combined rape (i.e., both force/threat of force and substance-related impairment were present; n = 29), and incapacitated rape (i.e., the participant was intoxicated to the point of unconsciousness; n = 28). We compared these groups on PTSD symptom severity within each symptom cluster, as well as on assault characteristics and consequences, including peritraumatic fear and injury, acknowledgment, and self-blame. Combined type rapes were associated with significantly more severe PTSD symptoms than forcible-only and impaired type rapes. Differences among the groups were also found for peritraumatic fear and injury, and rape acknowledgment. Utilizing a dichotomous approach to rape type overlooks the complexity of women’s experiences. Differences in PTSD symptom severity as a function of the proposed four-group conceptualization of rape type highlight the importance of assessing method of coercion when treating rape-related PTSD. Likewise, differences across rape types in peritraumatic fear and rape acknowledgment highlight the potential utility of type-specific targets of intervention.

T1  - Intimate Partner Violence Screening and Referral Practices in an Outpatient Care Setting
AN  - 2436792115
AB  - Health care providers who screen for intimate partner violence (IPV) and counsel patients can reduce victimization and positively impact women’s health and well-being; yet only 2% to 50% of medical professionals report routinely screening female patients. The purpose of this study was to identify current practices, policies, barriers, and opportunities for a coordinated and routinized response to IPV in an outpatient academic primary care clinic. Data were collected through interviews and the Physician Readiness to Manage Intimate Partner Violence questionnaire. Data on IPV screening practices over a 5-month period were also available through the electronic health record. Study participants expressed that there was no uniform method of documenting screening results and great variability in the patient populations and circumstances that prompted screening. Over two thirds of the survey respondents reported either a lack of IPV protocol or a lack of knowledge about one if it existed. Providers and staff who participated believed it was within their scope of work to screen for IPV and recognized IPV as a serious health threat; however, they cited an absence of patient education resources, a lack of staff training and awareness, and no established IPV referral network as barriers to screening for IPV. The results of the pilot are in line with existing research highlighting a general lack of screening, variability in process, and the absence of systems-level policies and protocols and linkages to community resources. Pilot findings have been used to initiate a project which encompasses routinized screening, documentation, and care coordination between providers and community organizations to improve patient well-being.

T1  - Childhood Trauma, Trait Anxiety, and Anxious Attachment as Predictors of Intimate Partner Violence in College Students
AN  - 2436792107
AB  - The current study investigates the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV), childhood trauma, trait anxiety, depression, and anxious attachment in college students. Ninety-three male and 161 female undergraduate students at Fairfield University, ranging in age from 17 to 23, with a mean age of 18.8 years, participated. Participants completed five self-report inventories: The Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationships Inventory (CADRI), the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Adult Attachment Scale (AAS). IPV perpetration in college dating relationships was related to childhood emotional and physical abuse, emotional and physical neglect, and trait anxiety. IPV victimization in college dating relationships was related to childhood emotional and physical abuse, childhood emotional and physical neglect, and an anxious attachment style. IPV perpetration and victimization were also significantly correlated with one another. Subscale analyses suggest that childhood emotional abuse was related to being both the perpetrator and victim of verbal or emotional abuse in dating relationships. Childhood physical abuse, physical neglect, and emotional abuse were related to both perpetration and victimization of physical IPV. Threatening behavior perpetration in dating relationships was related to childhood emotional abuse, emotional neglect, physical abuse, and physical neglect; however, being the victim of threatening behavior was only related to childhood emotional abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect, not childhood physical abuse. These results support the relationship between childhood trauma and dating violence in college students. They also support a role for anxiety in IPV, although trait anxiety was related to perpetration and an anxious attachment style was correlated with IPV victimization. In addition, they suggest that different experiences of childhood trauma may relate to different aspects of IPV in college dating relationships.
