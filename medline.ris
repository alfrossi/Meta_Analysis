N2  - PURPOSE: Sexual dysfunction is an important concern of premenopausal women with early breast cancer. We investigated predictors of sexual problems in two randomized controlled trials., METHODS: A subset of patients enrolled in TEXT and SOFT completed global and symptom-specific quality-of-life indicators, CES-Depression and MOS-Sexual Problems measures at baseline, six, 12 and 24 months. Mixed models tested the association of changes in treatment-induced symptoms (baseline to 6 months), depression at 6 months, and age at randomization with changes in sexual problems over 2 years., RESULTS: Sexual problems increased by 6 months and persisted at this level. Overall, patients with more severe worsening of vaginal dryness, sleep disturbances and bone or joint pain at 6 months reported a greater increase in sexual problems at all time-points. Depression scores were significantly associated with sexual problems in the short-term. All other symptoms had a smaller impact on sexual problems. Age was not associated with sexual problems at any time-point., CONCLUSION: Among several key symptoms, vaginal dryness, sleep disturbance, and bone and joint pain significantly predicted sexual problems during the first 2 years. Early identification of these symptoms may contribute to timely and tailored interventions.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Understanding the genetic background of complex diseases and disorders plays an essential role in the promising precision medicine. The evaluation of candidate genes, however, requires time-consuming and expensive experiments given a large number of possibilities. Thus, computational methods have seen increasing applications in predicting gene-disease associations. We proposed a bioinformatics framework, Prioritization of Autism-genes using Network-based Deep-learning Approach (PANDA). Our approach aims to identify autism-genes across the human genome based on patterns of gene-gene interactions and topological similarity of genes in the interaction network. PANDA trains a graph deep learning classifier using the input of the human molecular interaction network and predicts and ranks the probability of autism association of every node (gene) in the network. PANDA was able to achieve a high classification accuracy of 89%, outperforming three other commonly used machine learning algorithms. Moreover, the gene prioritization ranking list produced by PANDA was evaluated and validated using an independent large-scale exome-sequencing study. The top 10% of PANDA-ranked genes were found significantly enriched for autism association. Copyright Â© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Background: Higher income and education and lower income inequality in a neighbourhood have been shown to be related to better mental health outcome in developed countries. However, it is not clear whether these factors would affect the subjective well-being of the elderly, especially in a setting with recent rapid economic development. Methods: This study was conducted in 80 community centres with a total of 7552 community-dwelling elderly (mean age 75.9 years (SD = 7.79), 79% female) in Hong Kong. Income at individual level was measured as perceived disposable income. Education level was also collected. At district level, income was measured by district median household income and education was measured as the proportion of the population with no formal schooling. Income inequality was quantified using Gini coefficients. Low subjective well-being was defined as any one or a combination of the following: not satisfied with life, no meaning of life and being unhappy (Likert scale <= 2). Multilevel logistic regression was used to assess the association of income, education and income inequality and low subjective well-being. Results: We found that 15.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 14.5 to 16.1) of the elderly have low subjective well-being. Compared with elderly who reported a very adequate disposable income, those who reported a very inadequate disposable income are at increased risk of low subjective well-being (OR=5.08, 95%CI: 2.44 to 10.59). Compared with elderly with tertiary education, those with no formal schooling were at higher risk (OR=1.60, 95%CI 1.22 to 2.09). Income inequality was not related to subjective well-being. Conclusions: Elderly with inadequate disposable income and lower education level are more likely to suffer from low subjective well-being. At the neighbourhood level, income inequality was not related to subjective well-being. However, the relationships between neighbourhood income and education level and individuals' subjective well-being are not clear.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aims of our study are: to explore rehospitalization in mental health services across Italian regions, Local Health Districts (LHDs), and hospitals; to examine the predictive power of different clinical and organizational factors., METHODS: The data set included adult patients resident in Italy discharged from a general hospital episode with a main psychiatric diagnosis in 2012. Independent variables at the individual, hospital, LHD, and region levels were used. Outcome variables were individual-level readmission and LHD-level readmission rate to any hospital at 1-year follow-up. The association with readmission of each variable was assessed through both single- and multi-level logistic regression; descriptive statistics were provided to assess geographical variation. Relevance of contextual effects was investigated through a series of random-effects regressions without covariates., RESULTS: The national 1-year readmission rate was 43.0%, with a cross-regional coefficient of variation of 6.28%. Predictors of readmission were: admission in the same LHD as residence, psychotic disorder, higher length of stay (LoS), higher rate of public beds in the LHD; protective factors were: young age, involuntary admission, and intermediate number of public healthcare staff at the LHD level. Contextual factors turned out to affect readmission only to a limited degree., CONCLUSIONS: Homogeneity of readmission rates across regions, LHDs, hospitals, and groups of patients may be considered as a positive feature in terms of equity of the mental healthcare system. Our results highlight that readmission is mainly determined by individual-level factors. Future research is needed to better explore the relationship between readmission and LoS, discharge decision, and resource availability.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Child depression has been inconsistency linked to cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) reactivity. This study assessed three factors that contribute to inconsistencies: 1) the differential effectiveness of laboratory challenges to elicit cortisol and sAA; 2) the impact of cortisol-sAA coordination; and 3) variation in parent versus child ratings of depression. A community sample of 52 children participated in the Trier Social Stress Test-Child Version (TSST-C) and a competition challenge. Saliva was collected and assayed for cortisol and sAA. Analyses were conducted using multilevel modeling. Child-reported depressive symptoms were associated with a declining cortisol trajectory in the TSST-C. Mother-reported depressive symptoms were associated with higher baseline sAA in the TSST-C and the competition challenge. Further, child-reported depressive symptoms were associated with cortisol-sAA coordination in the competition challenge. Findings underscore the nature of the challenge and the behavioral informant as impacting associations between child depressive symptoms and cortisol and sAA secretion.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In the phase 3 COMBI-AD study, patients with resected, stage III melanoma with BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K mutations received adjuvant dabrafenib plus trametinib or placebo. The primary analysis showed that dabrafenib plus trametinib significantly improved relapse-free survival at 3 years. These results led to US Food and Drug Administration approval of dabrafenib plus trametinib as adjuvant treatment for patients with resected stage III melanoma with BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K mutations. Here, we report the patient-reported outcomes from COMBI-AD., METHODS: COMBI-AD was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study done at 169 sites in 25 countries. Study participants were aged 18 years or older and had complete resection of stage IIIA (lymph node metastases >1 mm), IIIB, or IIIC cutaneous melanoma as per American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition criteria, with BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K mutations, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice response system, stratified by mutation type and disease stage, to receive oral dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) plus oral trametinib (2 mg once daily) or matching placebos for 12 months. Patients, physicians, and the investigators who analysed the data were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival, reported elsewhere. Health-related quality of life, reported here, was a prespecified exploratory endpoint, and was assessed with the European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions 3-Levels (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire in the intention-to-treat population. We used a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis to assess differences in health-related quality of life between groups. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01682083. The trial is ongoing, but is no longer recruiting participants., FINDINGS: Between Jan 31, 2013, and Dec 11, 2014, 870 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive dabrafenib plus trametinib (n=438) or matching placebos (n=432). Data were collected until the data cutoff for analyses of the primary endpoint (June 30, 2017). The median follow-up was 34 months (IQR 28-39) in the dabrafenib plus trametinib group and 33 months (20.5-39) in the placebo group. During the 12-month treatment phase, there were no significant or clinically meaningful changes from baseline between groups in EQ-5D-3L visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) or utility scores. During treatment, there were no clinically meaningful differences in VAS scores or utility scores in the dabrafenib plus trametinib group between patients who did and did not experience the most common adverse events. During long-term follow-up (range 15-48 months), VAS and utility scores were similar between groups and did not differ from baseline scores. At recurrence, there were significant decreases in VAS scores in both the dabrafenib plus trametinib group (mean change -6.02, SD 20.57; p=0.0032) and the placebo group (-6.84, 20.86; p<0.0001); the mean change in utility score also differed significantly at recurrence for both groups (dabrafenib plus trametinib -0.0626, 0.1911, p<0.0001; placebo -0.0748, 0.2182, p<0.0001)., INTERPRETATION: These findings show that dabrafenib plus trametinib did not affect patient-reported outcome scores during or after adjuvant treatment, and suggest that preventing or delaying relapse with adjuvant therapy could be beneficial in this setting., FUNDING: Novartis.

N2  - Integrating gender in all aspects of health services is important and mental health is no exception. Despite several recommendations regarding the need for gender-sensitive mental health services, the actual availability of these is not clear, both in high and low-income countries. We sought to understand what aspects of gender-sensitive mental health care were considered a priority by global experts in women's mental health and how satisfied they were with the current availability of these services in their own place of work. A survey with 43 items under 7 domains of gender-sensitive mental health care for women was sent to 150 experts in women's mental health across the world, of whom 73 responded. Rating on each item was from 0 to 5. While majority of the experts rated most of the items as being very important (median score of 4 and above), some areas that were considered most important included training of mental health professionals in gender sensitivity, having private spaces for examination, using a life course approach to service planning and delivery, and assisting women who find it difficult to navigate the system and mother-baby units. However, satisfaction rates with available services were quite low overall and much lower among experts in low-income countries compared with those from high-income countries. Even in high-income countries, only 6 of the top 20 items were scored as satisfactory by at least 50% of experts. This expert survey method to arrive at consensus on top priorities for improving delivery of gender-sensitive mental health care indicates that at least 72% of the items provided in the survey were considered extremely important. Poor satisfaction of experts in both high- and low-income countries with availability of gender-sensitive services indicates the need for local and global strategic action and multilevel stakeholder engagement.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study analyzes whether income inequality within a community at the neighborhood level is associated with incidence of mood disorder in Japan., METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using the data of 116,658 National Health Insurance beneficiaries aged between 20 and 69 in Chiba City, Japan. To evaluate income inequality within a community, the Gini coefficient within a 30-min walking distance from an individual's residence was calculated using income distribution estimated by the National Census and the Housing and Land Survey 2013. Incidence of mood disorder was determined through insurance claims submitted from April 1, 2013, to March 31, 2016. A multilevel logistic analysis with three levels-the individual, household, and residential district-was performed to evaluate the association., RESULTS: Income inequality within a community at the neighborhood level was not associated with incidence of mood disorder in the models with and without equivalent household income (p for trend = 0.856 and 0.947, respectively). No difference was observed in the impact of the Gini coefficient among income levels, lower versus higher income groups (p for interaction between Gini coefficient and household income = 0.967). In contrast, lower equivalent income at the household level was significantly associated with higher incidence of mood disorder (p for trend < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: While we confirmed that lower income at the household level itself had an adverse effect on mental health, income inequality within a community at the neighborhood level was not a significant factor for incidence of mood disorder in Japan.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is frequently associated with behavioral disorders, particularly within the spectrum of motivated behaviors such as apathy or impulsivity. Both pharmacological and neurosurgical treatments have an impact on these impairments. However, there still is controversy as to whether subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) can cause or reduce impulsive behaviors., OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify the influence of functional surgery on decision-making processes in PD., METHODS: We studied 13 PD patients and 13 healthy controls. The experimental task involved squeezing a dynamometer with variable force to obtain rewards of various values under four conditions: without treatment, with l-dopa or subthalamic stimulation alone, and with both l-dopa and subthalamic stimulation. Statistical analyses consisted of generalized linear mixed models including treatment condition, reward value, level of effort, and their interactions. We analyzed acceptance rate (the percentage of accepted trials), decision time, and force applied., RESULTS: Comparatively to controls, patients without treatment exhibited lower acceptance rate and force applied. Patients under l-dopa alone did not exhibit increased acceptance rate. With subthalamic stimulation, either with or without added l-dopa, all measures were improved so that patients' behaviors were undistinguishable from healthy controls'., CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that l-dopa administration does not fully restore cost-benefit decision-making processes, whereas STN-DBS fully normalizes patients' behaviors. These findings suggest that dopamine is partly involved in cost-benefit valuation, and that STN-DBS can have a beneficial effect on motivated behaviors in PD and may improve certain forms of impulsive behaviors.

N2  - Antiretroviral therapies (ART) suppress HIV replication, thereby preventing HIV disease progression and potentially preventing HIV transmission. However, there remain significant health disparities among people living with HIV, particularly for women living in impoverished rural areas. A significant contributing factor to HIV-related disparities is a stigma. And yet, the relative contributions of stigma, gender, socio-economics, and geography in relation to health outcomes are understudied. We examined the associations of internalized stigma and enacted stigma with community-level income inequality and HIV viral suppression-the hallmark of successful ART-among 124 men and 74 women receiving care from a publicly funded HIV clinic serving rural areas with high-HIV prevalence in the southeastern US. Participants provided informed consent, completed computerized interviews, and provided access to their medical records. Gini index was collected at the census tract level to estimate community-level income inequality. Individual-level and multilevel models controlled for point distance that patients lived from the clinic and quality of life, and included participant gender as a moderator. We found that for women, income inequality, internalized stigma, and enacted stigma were significantly associated with HIV suppression. For men, there were no significant associations between viral suppression and model variables. The null findings for men are consistent with gender-based health disparities and suggest the need for gender-tailored prevention interventions to improve the health of people living with HIV in rural areas. Results confirm and help to explain previous research on the impact of HIV stigma and income inequality among people living with HIV in rural settings.

T1  - National levels of human development and number of mental hospital beds.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - AIMS: The number of mental hospital beds per population varies widely across countries, and the reasons for this variation are not fully understood. Given that differences in disease prevalence do not explain variation in inpatient mental health care availability, we examined the relationship between mental hospital beds and national income, education and longevity as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI)., METHODS: We used an international dataset of social, economic and structural measures to conduct a mixed-effects longitudinal regression of predictors of the number of mental hospital beds per 100 000 in the overall population for 86 countries for years 2005-2015., RESULTS: Our initial dataset contained 1881 observations consisting of 11 years of potential measurements across 171 countries. After eliminations based on missing data and subsequent imputation, the dataset for the final regression model included 946 observations over 86 countries. The primary predictors of a country's number of mental hospital beds were year, HDI and GINI coefficient, the latter being a measure of income disparity. Holding all other factors constant, the number of beds decreased 8% per year, reflecting the ongoing international trend of deinstitutionalisation. As hypothesised, higher HDI predicted more mental hospital beds. Every 0.1 increase in HDI (0-1.0) was associated with a 126% increase in the number of hospital beds at the sample's mean GINI index score of 38 (0-100). However, a strong interaction between HDI and the GINI coefficient indicated that a high level of income disparity attenuated the positive association between HDI and mental hospital beds. At a GINI index score of 48, every 0.1 increase in HDI was associated with a 71% increase in the number of hospital beds., CONCLUSIONS: As countries reduce the number of hospital beds over time, higher levels of economic disparity are associated with a reduction in the strength of the association between national prosperity and investment in mental hospitals. As power becomes increasingly concentrated, perhaps those with the least are more easily forgotten.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Use of involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation varies widely within and between countries. The factors that place individuals and populations at increased risk of involuntary hospitalisation are unclear, and evidence is needed to understand these disparities and inform development of interventions to reduce involuntary hospitalisation. We did a systematic review, meta-analysis, and narrative synthesis to investigate risk factors at the patient, service, and area level associated with involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation of adults., METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Register of Trials from Jan 1, 1983, to Aug 14, 2019, for studies comparing the characteristics of voluntary and involuntary psychiatric inpatients, and studies investigating the characteristics of involuntarily hospitalised individuals in general population samples. We synthesised results using random effects meta-analysis and narrative synthesis. Our review follows Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and is registered on PROSPERO, CRD42018095103., FINDINGS: 77 studies were included from 22 countries. Involuntary rather than voluntary hospitalisation was associated with male gender (odds ratio 1.23, 95% CI 1.14-1.32; p<0.0001), single marital status (1.47, 1.18-1.83; p<0.0001), unemployment (1.43, 1.07-1.90; p=0.020), receiving welfare benefits (1.71, 1.28-2.27; p<0.0001), being diagnosed with a psychotic disorder (2.18, 1.95-2.44; p<0.0001) or bipolar disorder (1.48, 1.24-1.76; p<0.0001), and previous involuntary hospitalisation (2.17, 1.62-2.91; p<0.0001). Using narrative synthesis, we found associations between involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation and perceived risk to others, positive symptoms of psychosis, reduced insight into illness, reduced adherence to treatment before hospitalisation, and police involvement in admission. On a population level, some evidence was noted of a positive dose-response relation between area deprivation and involuntary hospitalisation., INTERPRETATION: Previous involuntary hospitalisation and diagnosis of a psychotic disorder were factors associated with the greatest risk of involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation. People with these risk factors represent an important target group for preventive interventions, such as crisis planning. Economic deprivation on an individual level and at the population level was associated with increased risk for involuntary hospitalisation. Mechanisms underpinning the risk factors could not be identified using the available evidence. Further research is therefore needed with an integrative approach, which examines clinical, social, and structural factors, alongside qualitative research into clinical decision-making processes and patients' experiences of the detention process., FUNDING: Commissioned by the Department of Health and funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) via the NIHR Mental Health Policy Research Unit.

T1  - Effective genetic-risk prediction using mixed models.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - For predicting genetic risk, we propose a statistical approach that is specifically adapted to dealing with the challenges imposed by disease phenotypes and case-control sampling. Our approach (termed Genetic Risk Scores Inference [GeRSI]), combines the power of fixed-effects models (which estimate and aggregate the effects of single SNPs) and random-effects models (which rely primarily on whole-genome similarities between individuals) within the framework of the widely used liability-threshold model. We demonstrate in extensive simulation that GeRSI produces predictions that are consistently superior to current state-of-the-art approaches. When applying GeRSI to seven phenotypes from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) study, we confirm that the use of random effects is most beneficial for diseases that are known to be highly polygenic: hypertension (HT) and bipolar disorder (BD). For HT, there are no significant associations in the WTCCC data. The fixed-effects model yields an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 54%, whereas GeRSI improves it to 59%. For BD, using GeRSI improves the AUC from 55% to 62%. For individuals ranked at the top 10% of BD risk predictions, using GeRSI substantially increases the BD relative risk from 1.4 to 2.5.

N1  - Update of (UOF)
N2  - BACKGROUND: This is an update of the review last published in 2011. It focuses on early postoperative enteral nutrition after lower gastrointestinal surgery. Traditional management consisted of 'nil by mouth', where patients receive fluids followed by solids after bowel function has returned. Although several trials have reported lower incidence of infectious complications and faster wound healing upon early feeding, other trials have shown no effect. The immediate advantage of energy intake (carbohydrates, protein or fat) could enhance recovery with fewer complications, and this warrants a systematic evaluation., OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether early commencement of postoperative enteral nutrition (within 24 hours), oral intake and any kind of tube feeding (gastric, duodenal or jejunal), compared with traditional management (delayed nutritional supply) is associated with a shorter length of hospital stay (LoS), fewer complications, mortality and adverse events in patients undergoing lower gastrointestinal surgery (distal to the ligament of Treitz)., SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library 2017, issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to 15 November 2017), Ovid Embase (1974 to 15 November 2017). We also searched for ongoing trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (15 November 2017). We handsearched reference lists of identified studies and previous systematic reviews., SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing early commencement of enteral nutrition (within 24 hours) with no feeding in adult participants undergoing lower gastrointestinal surgery., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed study quality using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool tailored to this review and extracted data. Data analyses were conducted according to the Cochrane recommendations. We rated the quality of evidence according to GRADE.Primary outcomes were LoS and postoperative complications (wound infections, intraabdominal abscesses, anastomotic dehiscence, pneumonia). Secondary outcomes were: mortality, adverse events (nausea, vomiting), and quality of life (QoL). LoS was estimated using mean difference (MD (presented as mean +/- SD). For other outcomes we estimated the common risk ratio (RR) and calculated the associated 95% confidence intervals. For analysis, we used an inverse-variance random-effects model for the primary outcome (LoS) and Mantel-Haenszel random-effects models for the secondary outcomes. We also performed Trial Sequential Analyses (TSA)., MAIN RESULTS: We identified 17 RCTs with 1437 participants undergoing lower gastrointestinal surgery. Most studies were at high or unclear risk of bias in two or more domains. Six studies were judged as having low risk of selection bias for random sequence generation and insufficient details were provided for judgement on allocation concealment in all 17 studies. With regards to performance and deception bias; 14 studies reported no attempt to blind participants and blinding of personnel was not discussed either. Only one study was judged as low risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessor. With regards to incomplete outcome data, three studies were judged to be at high risk because they had more than 10% difference in missing data between groups. For selective reporting, nine studies were judged as unclear as protocols were not provided and eight studies had issues with either missing data or incomplete reporting of results.LOS was reported in 16 studies (1346 participants). The mean LoS ranged from four days to 16 days in the early feeding groups and from 6.6 days to 23.5 days in the control groups. Mean difference (MD) in LoS was 1.95 (95% CI, -2.99 to -0.91, P < 0.001) days shorter in the early feeding group. However, there was substantial heterogeneity between included studies (I2 = 81, %, Chi2 = 78.98, P < 0.00001), thus the overall quality of evidence for LoS is low. These results were confirmed by the TSA showing that the cumulative Z-curve crossed the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit. We found no differences in the incidence of postoperative complications: wound infection (12 studies, 1181 participants, RR 0.99, 95%CI 0.64 to 1.52, very low-quality evidence), intraabdominal abscesses (6 studies, 554 participants, RR 1.00, 95%CI 0.26 to 3.80, low-quality evidence), anastomotic leakage/dehiscence (13 studies, 1232 participants, RR 0.78, 95%CI 0.38 to 1.61, low-quality evidence; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 100), and pneumonia (10 studies, 954 participants, RR 0.88, 95%CI 0.32 to 2.42, low-quality evidence; NNTB = 333). Mortality was reported in 12 studies (1179 participants), and showed no between-group differences (RR = 0.56, 95%CI, 0.21 to 1.52, P = 0.26, I2 = 0%, Chi2 = 3.08, P = 0.96, low-quality evidence). The most commonly reported cause of death was anastomotic leakage, sepsis and acute myocardial infarction.Seven studies (613 participants) reported vomiting (RR 1.23, 95%CI, 0.96 to 1.58, P = 0.10, I2 = 0%, Chi2 = 4.98, P = 0.55, low-quality evidence; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 19), and two studies (118 participants) reported nausea (RR 0.95, 0.71 to 1.26, low-quality evidence). Four studies reported combined nausea and vomiting (RR 0.94, 95%CI 0.51 to 1.74, very low-quality evidence). One study reported QoL assessment; the scores did not differ between groups at 30 days after discharge on either QoL scale EORTC QLQ-C30 or EORTC QlQ-OV28 (very low-quality evidence)., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that early enteral feeding may lead to a reduced postoperative LoS, however cautious interpretation must be taken due to substantial heterogeneity and low-quality evidence. For all other outcomes (postoperative complications, mortality, adverse events, and QoL) the findings are inconclusive, and further trials are justified to enhance the understanding of early feeding for these. In this updated review, only a few additional studies have been included, and these were small and of poor quality.To improve the evidence, future trials should address quality issues and focus on clearly defining and measuring postoperative complications to allow for better comparison between studies. However due to the introduction of fast track protocols which already include an early feeding component, future trials may be challenging. A more feasible trial may be to investigate the effect of differing postoperative energy intake regimens on relevant outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder with a prevalence of about 1% among the general population. It is listed among the top 10 causes of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide. Antipsychotics are the mainstay treatment. Piperacetazine has been reported to be as clinically effective as chlorpromazine, a well established 'benchmark' antipsychotic, for people with schizophrenia. However, the side effect profiles of these antipsychotics differ and it is important that an evidence base is available comparing the benefits, and potential harms of these two antipsychotics., OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical and side effects of chlorpromazine for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses in comparison with piperacetazine., SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (6 June 2015 and 8 October 2018) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, CENTRAL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register., SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on chlorpromazine versus piperacetazine for people with schizophrenia, reporting useable data., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE., MAIN RESULTS: We found 12 records referring to six trials. We included five trials, all from the 1970s, randomising 343 participants. We excluded one trial. The overall methodology and data reporting by the trials was poor. Only short-term data were available. Results from the included trials found that, in terms of global state improvement, when rated by a psychiatrist, there was no clear difference between chlorpromazine and piperacetazine (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.02; participants = 208; studies = 2; very low-quality evidence). One trial reported change scores on the mental state scale Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS); no clear difference was observed (MD -0.40, 95% CI -1.41 to 0.61; participants = 182; studies = 1; very low-quality evidence). Chlorpromazine appears no worse or better than piperacetazine regarding adverse effects. In both treatment groups, around 60% of participants experienced some sort of adverse effect (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.33; participants = 74; studies = 3; very low-quality evidence), with approximately 40% of these participants experiencing some parkinsonism-type movement disorder (RR 0.95, CI 0.61 to 1.49; participants = 106; studies = 3; very low-quality evidence). No clear difference in numbers of participants leaving the study early for any reason was observed (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.56; participants = 256; studies = 4; very low-quality evidence). No trial reported data for change in negative symptoms or economic costs., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review show chlorpromazine and piperacetazine may have similar clinical efficacy, but data are based on very small numbers of participants and the evidence is very low quality. We can not make firm conclusions based on such data. Currently, should clinicians and people with schizophrenia need to choose between chlorpromazine and piperacetazine they should be aware there is no good quality evidence to base decisions. More high quality research is needed.

T1  - Cross-sectional human immunodeficiency virus incidence estimation accounting for heterogeneity across communities.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Accurate estimation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) incidence rates is crucial for the monitoring of HIV epidemics, the evaluation of prevention programs, and the design of prevention studies. Traditional cohort approaches to measure HIV incidence require repeatedly testing large cohorts of HIV-uninfected individuals with an HIV diagnostic test (eg, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) for long periods of time to identify new infections, which can be prohibitively costly, time-consuming, and subject to loss to follow-up. Cross-sectional approaches based on the usual HIV diagnostic test and biomarkers of recent infection offer important advantages over standard cohort approaches, in terms of time, cost, and attrition. Cross-sectional samples usually consist of individuals from different communities. However, small sample sizes limit the ability to estimate community-specific incidence and existing methods typically ignore heterogeneity in incidence across communities. We propose a permutation test for the null hypothesis of no heterogeneity in incidence rates across communities, develop a random-effects model to account for this heterogeneity and to estimate community-specific incidence, and provide one way to estimate the coefficient of variation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods through simulation studies and apply them to the data from the National Institute of Mental Health Project ACCEPT, a phase 3 randomized controlled HIV prevention trial in Sub-Saharan Africa, to estimate the overall and community-specific HIV incidence rates.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patient response burden is often raised as a human subject concern in consideration of the length or complexity of patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments used in oncology., OBJECTIVES: To quantify patient response burden and identify its predictive factors., METHODS: Data were collected presurgically during a prospective trial that used a comprehensive symptom and health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) PRO assessment. A subset of patients also completed HRQOL interviews. Response burden was captured using an internally developed six-item instrument. Demographic and clinical characteristics as well as HRQOL scores were examined as potential predictors using hierarchical regression. Response burden was used to predict participant dropout at the first follow-up interval., RESULTS: A total of 275 patients (mean age 67.5 years; 23.6% female) completed surveys (n = 126) or surveys in addition to interviews (n = 149). Patients experienced low response burden (mean 12.19 +/- 11.65). Repetitive questions were identified by 60 patients (21.8%), whereas 31.6% indicated that additional information should be gathered; 35 patients (12.7%) identified repetitive questions and expressed a desire for additional items. Low self-reported cognitive function was a significant predictor of higher response burden (beta = -0.20; t(270) = -3.38; P = 0.01; model-adjusted R2 = 0.04). Response burden was not a significant predictor of study dropout., CONCLUSIONS: Despite completing a large battery of PRO measures and interviews, patients reported minimal response burden, with nearly one-third expressing that more questions should have been asked. Patients with lower cognitive function are more likely to report higher response burden when completing PRO measures. Further examination of patient characteristics related to response burden may reveal useful pathways for tailoring patient-centered interventions.

N2  - Green space has been identified as a modifiable feature of the urban environment and associations with physiological and psychological health have been reported at the local level. This study aims to assess whether these associations between health and green space are transferable to a larger scale, with English cities as the unit of analysis. We used an ecological, cross-sectional study design. We classified satellite-based land cover data to quantify green space coverage for the 50 largest cities in England. We assessed associations between city green space coverage with risk of death from all causes, cardiovascular disease, lung cancer and suicide between 2002 and 2009 using Poisson regression with random effect. After adjustment for age, income deprivation and air pollution, we found that at the city level the risk of death from all causes and a priori selected causes, for men and women, did not significantly differ between the greenest and least green cities. These findings suggest that the local health effects of urban green space observed at the neighbourhood level in some studies do not transfer to the city level. Further work is needed to establish how urban residents interact with local green space, in order to ascertain the most relevant measures of green space.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Childhood dysregulation, which reflects deficits in the capacity to regulate or control one's thoughts, emotions and behaviours, is associated with psychopathology throughout childhood and into adulthood. Exposures to adversity during the prenatal period, including prenatal depression, can influence the development of dysregulation, and a number of candidate genes have been suggested as moderators of prenatal exposure, including polymorphisms in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR). We examined whether prenatal depression and child 5-HTTLPR interact to predict childhood dysregulation., METHOD: Sample of N = 213 mother-child pairs from the Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment (MAVAN) project. Mothers reported the IBQ-R at 3 and 6 months, and the ECBQ at 18 and 36 months, from which measures of dysregulation were extracted. Mothers' self-reported symptoms of depression on the CES-D at 24-36 weeks of gestation, and at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months postnatal. 5-HTTLPR genotype was extracted from buccal swabs. Mixed-model and confirmatory analyses were conducted., RESULTS: Prenatal depression and 5-HTTLPR interacted to predict dysregulation from 3 to 36 months, within a model of strong differential susceptibility., CONCLUSION: Children with S or LG alleles, when exposed to prenatal depression, have higher levels of dysregulation, and when exposed to lower or little prenatal depression, have higher capacity for regulation. Our findings support efforts to identify, support and treat prenatal depression. Copyright Â© 2014 The Authors. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between social and health contextual variables, and between major depressive episodes (MDE) and suicidal thoughts in Brazilian adults., METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study used data from the 2013 National Health Survey (Pesquisa Nacional de Saude). The Patient Health Questionnaire was used to evaluate the presence of MDE and suicidal thoughts. We used number of Family Health Strategy teams (FHS) per 20,000 state population, number of Psychosocial Care Centers (Centros de Atencao Psicossocial [CAPS]) per 1,000 state population, gross domestic product (GDP), and Gini index for each Brazilian state as contextual variables. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to calculate OR and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)., RESULTS: Prevalence of MDE and suicidal thoughts was 4.1% (95%CI 3.8-4.4) and 3.8% (95%CI 3.5-4.1), respectively. Multilevel regression models showed an ICC of 1.1% for MDE (95%CI 0.5-2.3) and 1.3% for suicidal thoughts (95%CI 0.6-2.6). Neither GDP, Gini, FHS, or CAPS showed evidence of association with the outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: In general, contextual variables, within each Brazilian state, do not seem to affect the prevalence of MDE and suicidal thoughts.

N2  - Despite modern combination antiretroviral therapy, distal neuropathic pain (DNP) continues to affect many individuals with HIV infection. We evaluated risk factors for new-onset DNP in the CNS Antiretroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) study, an observational cohort. Standardized, semiannual clinical evaluations were administered at 6 US sites. Distal neuropathic pain was defined by using a clinician-administered instrument standardized across sites. All participants analyzed were free of DNP at study entry. New-onset DNP was recorded at the first follow-up visit at which it was reported. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to evaluate potential predictors including HIV disease and treatment factors, demographics, medical comorbidities, and neuropsychiatric factors. Among 493 participants, 131 (27%) reported new DNP over 2306 visits during a median follow-up of 24 months (interquartile range 12-42). In multivariable regression, after adjusting for other covariates, significant entry predictors of new DNP were older age, female sex, current and past antiretroviral treatment, lack of virologic suppression, and lifetime history of opioid use disorder. During follow-up, more severe depression symptoms conferred a significantly elevated risk. The associations with opioid use disorders and depression reinforce the view that the clinical expression of neuropathic pain with peripheral nerve disease is strongly influenced by neuropsychiatric factors. Delineating such risk factors might help target emerging preventive strategies, for example, to individuals with a history of opioid use disorder, or might lead to new treatment approaches such as the use of tools to ameliorate depressed mood.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The financial crisis of 2008/2009, for some also in 2011, was accompanied by increasing social inequality and unemployment, which strained the welfare generosity systems in many countries. Welfare generosity redistributes internal resources to decrease poverty and increase equal opportunities. This was used by many countries to combat the crisis. We investigated the effects of increased social inequality, unemployment and welfare generosity on life satisfaction (LS) before and after the crisis., METHODS: A representative sample from the European Social Survey (2002 to 2014) with data from 26 countries was used (N = 301,559). Time from start of crisis (either 2008 or 2010-2012) was determined separately for each case. LS was measured with a single question with 11 response alternatives. Social inequality was measured using the Gini index. Unemployment was measured by a single question (No/Yes). Welfare generosity was measured using expenditure on social protection (PPS) per inhabitant (Eurostat). Data were analyzed by multilevel analysis and multilevel mediation analysis., RESULTS: Welfare generosity was associated with decreased levels of social inequality. The negative relationship between social inequality and LS was weakened when controlling for welfare generosity after the financial crisis. This effect of welfare generosity was not seen for the negative impact of unemployment on LS., CONCLUSION: The financial crisis stimulated the use of welfare generosity in Europe and strengthened the positive relationship between welfare generosity and LS. Social inequality, unemployment and welfare generosity played significant mediator roles between the crisis and LS, with increased welfare generosity far more strongly associated with increased LS. Measures that increase social equality in a country and thereby increase equal opportunity for all social classes, may be assumed to be effective in improving the general LS of the population in a country in times of economic crisis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This is an update of the review last published in 2011. It focuses on early postoperative enteral nutrition after lower gastrointestinal surgery. Traditional management consisted of 'nil by mouth', where patients receive fluids followed by solids after bowel function has returned. Although several trials have reported lower incidence of infectious complications and faster wound healing upon early feeding, other trials have shown no effect. The immediate advantage of energy intake (carbohydrates, protein or fat) could enhance recovery with fewer complications, and this warrants a systematic evaluation., OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether early commencement of postoperative enteral nutrition (within 24 hours), oral intake and any kind of tube feeding (gastric, duodenal or jejunal), compared with traditional management (delayed nutritional supply) is associated with a shorter length of hospital stay (LoS), fewer complications, mortality and adverse events in patients undergoing lower gastrointestinal surgery (distal to the ligament of Treitz)., SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library 2017, issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to 15 November 2017), Ovid Embase (1974 to 15 November 2017). We also searched for ongoing trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (15 November 2017). We handsearched reference lists of identified studies and previous systematic reviews., SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing early commencement of enteral nutrition (within 24 hours) with no feeding in adult participants undergoing lower gastrointestinal surgery., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed study quality using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool tailored to this review and extracted data. Data analyses were conducted according to the Cochrane recommendations. We rated the quality of evidence according to GRADE.Primary outcomes were LoS and postoperative complications (wound infections, intraabdominal abscesses, anastomotic dehiscence, pneumonia). Secondary outcomes were: mortality, adverse events (nausea, vomiting), and quality of life (QoL). LoS was estimated using mean difference (MD (presented as mean +/- SD). For other outcomes we estimated the common risk ratio (RR) and calculated the associated 95% confidence intervals. For analysis, we used an inverse-variance random-effects model for the primary outcome (LoS) and Mantel-Haenszel random-effects models for the secondary outcomes. We also performed Trial Sequential Analyses (TSA)., MAIN RESULTS: We identified 17 RCTs with 1437 participants undergoing lower gastrointestinal surgery. Most studies were at high or unclear risk of bias in two or more domains. Six studies were judged as having low risk of selection bias for random sequence generation and insufficient details were provided for judgement on allocation concealment in all 17 studies. With regards to performance and deception bias; 14 studies reported no attempt to blind participants and blinding of personnel was not discussed either. Only one study was judged as low risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessor. With regards to incomplete outcome data, three studies were judged to be at high risk because they had more than 10% difference in missing data between groups. For selective reporting, nine studies were judged as unclear as protocols were not provided and eight studies had issues with either missing data or incomplete reporting of results.LOS was reported in 16 studies (1346 participants). The mean LoS ranged from four days to 16 days in the early feeding groups and from 6.6 days to 23.5 days in the control groups. Mean difference (MD) in LoS was 1.95 (95% CI, -2.99 to -0.91, P < 0.001) days shorter in the early feeding group. However, there was substantial heterogeneity between included studies (I2 = 81, %, Chi2 = 78.98, P < 0.00001), thus the overall quality of evidence for LoS is low. These results were confirmed by the TSA showing that the cumulative Z-curve crossed the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit. We found no differences in the incidence of postoperative complications: wound infection (12 studies, 1181 participants, RR 0.99, 95%CI 0.64 to 1.52, very low-quality evidence), intraabdominal abscesses (6 studies, 554 participants, RR 1.00, 95%CI 0.26 to 3.80, low-quality evidence), anastomotic leakage/dehiscence (13 studies, 1232 participants, RR 0.78, 95%CI 0.38 to 1.61, low-quality evidence; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 100), and pneumonia (10 studies, 954 participants, RR 0.88, 95%CI 0.32 to 2.42, low-quality evidence; NNTB = 333). Mortality was reported in 12 studies (1179 participants), and showed no between-group differences (RR = 0.56, 95%CI, 0.21 to 1.52, P = 0.26, I2 = 0%, Chi2 = 3.08, P = 0.96, low-quality evidence). The most commonly reported cause of death was anastomotic leakage, sepsis and acute myocardial infarction.Seven studies (613 participants) reported vomiting (RR 1.23, 95%CI, 0.96 to 1.58, P = 0.10, I2 = 0%, Chi2 = 4.98, P = 0.55, low-quality evidence; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 19), and two studies (118 participants) reported nausea (RR 0.95, 0.71 to 1.26, low-quality evidence). Four studies reported combined nausea and vomiting (RR 0.94, 95%CI 0.51 to 1.74, very low-quality evidence). One study reported QoL assessment; the scores did not differ between groups at 30 days after discharge on either QoL scale EORTC QLQ-C30 or EORTC QlQ-OV28 (very low-quality evidence)., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that early enteral feeding may lead to a reduced postoperative LoS, however cautious interpretation must be taken due to substantial heterogeneity and low-quality evidence. For all other outcomes (postoperative complications, mortality, adverse events, and QoL) the findings are inconclusive, and further trials are justified to enhance the understanding of early feeding for these. In this updated review, only a few additional studies have been included, and these were small and of poor quality.To improve the evidence, future trials should address quality issues and focus on clearly defining and measuring postoperative complications to allow for better comparison between studies. However due to the introduction of fast track protocols which already include an early feeding component, future trials may be challenging. A more feasible trial may be to investigate the effect of differing postoperative energy intake regimens on relevant outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The benefits and safety of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remain controversial, and guidelines are inconsistent on which medications are preferred across different age groups. We aimed to estimate the comparative efficacy and tolerability of oral medications for ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults., METHODS: We did a literature search for published and unpublished double-blind randomised controlled trials comparing amphetamines (including lisdexamfetamine), atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, methylphenidate, and modafinil with each other or placebo. We systematically contacted study authors and drug manufacturers for additional information. Primary outcomes were efficacy (change in severity of ADHD core symptoms based on teachers' and clinicians' ratings) and tolerability (proportion of patients who dropped out of studies because of side-effects) at timepoints closest to 12 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks. We estimated summary odds ratios (ORs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects. We assessed the risk of bias of individual studies with the Cochrane risk of bias tool and confidence of estimates with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for network meta-analyses. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42014008976., FINDINGS: 133 double-blind randomised controlled trials (81 in children and adolescents, 51 in adults, and one in both) were included. The analysis of efficacy closest to 12 weeks was based on 10 068 children and adolescents and 8131 adults; the analysis of tolerability was based on 11 018 children and adolescents and 5362 adults. The confidence of estimates varied from high or moderate (for some comparisons) to low or very low (for most indirect comparisons). For ADHD core symptoms rated by clinicians in children and adolescents closest to 12 weeks, all included drugs were superior to placebo (eg, SMD -1.02, 95% CI -1.19 to -0.85 for amphetamines, -0.78, -0.93 to -0.62 for methylphenidate, -0.56, -0.66 to -0.45 for atomoxetine). By contrast, for available comparisons based on teachers' ratings, only methylphenidate (SMD -0.82, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.48) and modafinil (-0.76, -1.15 to -0.37) were more efficacious than placebo. In adults (clinicians' ratings), amphetamines (SMD -0.79, 95% CI -0.99 to -0.58), methylphenidate (-0.49, -0.64 to -0.35), bupropion (-0.46, -0.85 to -0.07), and atomoxetine (-0.45, -0.58 to -0.32), but not modafinil (0.16, -0.28 to 0.59), were better than placebo. With respect to tolerability, amphetamines were inferior to placebo in both children and adolescents (odds ratio [OR] 2.30, 95% CI 1.36-3.89) and adults (3.26, 1.54-6.92); guanfacine was inferior to placebo in children and adolescents only (2.64, 1.20-5.81); and atomoxetine (2.33, 1.28-4.25), methylphenidate (2.39, 1.40-4.08), and modafinil (4.01, 1.42-11.33) were less well tolerated than placebo in adults only. In head-to-head comparisons, only differences in efficacy (clinicians' ratings) were found, favouring amphetamines over modafinil, atomoxetine, and methylphenidate in both children and adolescents (SMDs -0.46 to -0.24) and adults (-0.94 to -0.29). We did not find sufficient data for the 26-week and 52-week timepoints., INTERPRETATION: Our findings represent the most comprehensive available evidence base to inform patients, families, clinicians, guideline developers, and policymakers on the choice of ADHD medications across age groups.

N2  - BACKGROUND: For a number of fiscal and practical reasons, data on heroin use have been of poor quality, which has hampered the ability to halt the growing epidemic. Internet search data, such as those made available by Google Trends, have been used as a low-cost, real-time data source for monitoring and predicting a variety of public health outcomes. We aimed to determine whether data on opioid-related internet searches might predict future heroin-related admissions to emergency departments (ED)., METHODS: Across nine metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the United States, we obtained data on Google searches for prescription and non-prescription opioids, as well as Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) data on heroin-related ED visits from 2004 to 2011. A linear mixed model assessed the relationship between opioid-related Internet searches and following year heroin-related visits, controlling for MSA GINI index and total number of ED visits., RESULTS: The best-fitting model explained 72% of the variance in heroin-related ED visits. The final model included the search keywords "Avinza," "Brown Sugar," "China White," "Codeine," "Kadian," "Methadone," and "Oxymorphone." We found regional differences in where and how people searched for opioid-related information., CONCLUSIONS: Internet search-based modeling should be explored as a new source of insights for predicting heroin-related admissions. In geographic regions where no current heroin-related data exist, Internet search modeling might be a particularly valuable and inexpensive tool for estimating changing heroin use trends. We discuss the immediate implications for using this approach to assist in managing opioid-related morbidity and mortality in the United States. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests significant increases in suicide mortality rates in European countries following the economic crisis of 2008. However, the relationship between national differences in availability and use of mental health services and suicide rates has not been extensively examined yet., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on mental health services and socioeconomic variables were derived from Eurostat for the years 2000-2013 for ten European countries. The national health care variables consisted of suicide mortality rate (SMR), average length of hospital stay and number of hospitalizations due to affective disorder or any psychiatric disorder, number of psychiatric beds and number of prescribed antidepressants. Economic variables included the gross domestic product (GDP), the gross domestic product per 1000 inhabitants (Real GDP), the rate of unemployment and the GINI-coefficient as a measurement for the equality of wealth distribution. Mixed models were used to investigate the potential influence of the onset of the economic crisis in 2008 on each of the psychiatric variables. Multivariable regression analyses were used to assess the influence on suicide mortality rates., RESULTS: In this study, a significant change in slope starting from 2008 was revealed for the number of psychiatric beds, hospitalizations due to affective disorder or any psychiatric disorder and for prescribed antidepressants. Furthermore, a significant step change for hospitalizations due to affective disorder was observed in 2008. SMR exhibited a significant step change in 2008 for males and females as well as a significant change in slope from 2008 onwards for males only. Contrary to our hypothesis, most variables showed no statistically significant influence on SMR. Only a higher number of available psychiatric beds was significantly associated with higher suicide mortality rates. This effect, however, was only significant for females and did not remain significant after correcting for economic variables. Less than 10% of suicide mortality rate variability could be explained by a model including all variables, further corroborating the multifactorial etiology of suicide., LIMITATIONS: Since administrative registry data was used, the results should be interpreted with caution. Results might not be applicable to countries not included., CONCLUSION: While significant changes in the psychiatric variables, as well as SMR, were observed, no statistically significant influence on SMR remained after correcting for country, time and economic variables. Our study suggests the necessity of a more comprehensive international data gathering effort. Further research is needed to identify populations at risk of suicide. Copyright Â© 2018.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Inpatient psychiatric readmissions are often used as an indicator of the quality of care and their reduction is in line with international recommendations for mental health care. Research on variations in inpatient readmission rates among mental health care providers is therefore of key importance as these variations can impact equity, quality and efficiency of care when they do not result from differences in patients' needs., AIMS OF THE STUDY: Our objectives were first to describe variations in inpatient readmission rates between public mental health care providers in France on a nationwide scale, and second, to identify their association with patient, health care providers and environment characteristics., METHODS: We carried out a study for the year 2012 using data from ten administrative national databases. 30-day readmissions in inpatient care were identified in the French national psychiatric discharge database. Variations were described numerically and graphically between French psychiatric sectors and factors associated with these variations were identified by carrying out a multi-level logistic regression accounting for the hierarchical structure of the data., RESULTS: Significant practice variations in 30-day inpatient readmission rates were observed with a coefficient of variation above 50%. While a majority of those variations was related to differences within sectors, individual patient characteristics explained a lower part of the variations resulting from differences between sectors than the characteristics of sectors and of their environment. In particular, an increase in the mortality rate and in the acute admission rate for somatic disorders in sectors' catchment area was associated with a decrease in the probability of 30-day readmission. Similarly, an increase in the number of psychiatric inpatient beds in private for-profit hospitals per 1,000 inhabitants in sectors' catchment area was associated with a decrease in this probability, which also varied with overall sectors' case-mix characteristics and with the level of urbanisation of the area., DISCUSSION: The extent of the variations and the factors associated with it question the adequacy of care and suggest that some of them may be unwarranted. Our findings should however be interpreted in consideration of several limits inherent to data quality and availability as we relied on information from administrative databases. While we considered a wide range of factors potentially associated with variations in 30-day readmissions, our model indeed only explained a limited part of the variations resulting from differences between sectors., IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICIES: Our findings underscored that practice variations in psychiatry are a reality that merits the full attention of decision makers as they can impact the quality, equity and efficiency of care. A specific data system should be established to monitor practice variations in routine to promote transparency and accountability., IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: Few associations were found between variations in 30-day inpatient readmissions and the supply of care. The routine collection of detailed organizational characteristics of health care providers at a national level should be supported to facilitate additional research work, both in France and in other contexts.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is one of the most common, burdensome, and costly psychiatric disorders worldwide in adults. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are available; however, because of inadequate resources, antidepressants are used more frequently than psychological interventions. Prescription of these agents should be informed by the best available evidence. Therefore, we aimed to update and expand our previous work to compare and rank antidepressants for the acute treatment of adults with unipolar major depressive disorder., METHODS: We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS database, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, PsycINFO, the websites of regulatory agencies, and international registers for published and unpublished, double-blind, randomised controlled trials from their inception to Jan 8, 2016. We included placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of 21 antidepressants used for the acute treatment of adults (>=18 years old and of both sexes) with major depressive disorder diagnosed according to standard operationalised criteria. We excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials that were incomplete or included 20% or more of participants with bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, or treatment-resistant depression; or patients with a serious concomitant medical illness. We extracted data following a predefined hierarchy. In network meta-analysis, we used group-level data. We assessed the studies' risk of bias in accordance to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Primary outcomes were efficacy (response rate) and acceptability (treatment discontinuations due to any cause). We estimated summary odds ratios (ORs) using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012002291., FINDINGS: We identified 28 552 citations and of these included 522 trials comprising 116 477 participants. In terms of efficacy, all antidepressants were more effective than placebo, with ORs ranging between 2.13 (95% credible interval [CrI] 1.89-2.41) for amitriptyline and 1.37 (1.16-1.63) for reboxetine. For acceptability, only agomelatine (OR 0.84, 95% CrI 0.72-0.97) and fluoxetine (0.88, 0.80-0.96) were associated with fewer dropouts than placebo, whereas clomipramine was worse than placebo (1.30, 1.01-1.68). When all trials were considered, differences in ORs between antidepressants ranged from 1.15 to 1.55 for efficacy and from 0.64 to 0.83 for acceptability, with wide CrIs on most of the comparative analyses. In head-to-head studies, agomelatine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine were more effective than other antidepressants (range of ORs 1.19-1.96), whereas fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, and trazodone were the least efficacious drugs (0.51-0.84). For acceptability, agomelatine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and vortioxetine were more tolerable than other antidepressants (range of ORs 0.43-0.77), whereas amitriptyline, clomipramine, duloxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, trazodone, and venlafaxine had the highest dropout rates (1.30-2.32). 46 (9%) of 522 trials were rated as high risk of bias, 380 (73%) trials as moderate, and 96 (18%) as low; and the certainty of evidence was moderate to very low., INTERPRETATION: All antidepressants were more efficacious than placebo in adults with major depressive disorder. Smaller differences between active drugs were found when placebo-controlled trials were included in the analysis, whereas there was more variability in efficacy and acceptability in head-to-head trials. These results should serve evidence-based practice and inform patients, physicians, guideline developers, and policy makers on the relative merits of the different antidepressants., FUNDING: National Institute for Health Research Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

N2  - A typical clinical manifestation of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is a short stature resulting from delayed growth, but GHD affects bone health, cardiovascular function and metabolic profile and therefore quality of life. Although early GH treatment during childhood has been shown to improve outcomes, no single biochemical parameter is currently available for the accurate diagnosis of GHD in children. There is hence a need for non-invasive biomarkers. In this study, the relative abundance of serum proteins from GHD children and healthy controls was measured by next-generation proteomics SWATH-MS technology. The data generated was analysed by machine-learning feature-selection algorithms in order to discover the minimum number of protein biomarkers that best discriminate between both groups. The analysis of serum proteins by a SWATH-MS approach yielded a useful method for discovering potential biomarkers of GHD in children. A total of 263 proteins were confidently detected and quantified in each sample. Pathway analysis indicated an effect on tissue/organ structure and morphogenesis. The top ten serum protein biomarker candidates were identified after applying feature-selection data analysis. The combination of three proteins - apolipoprotein A-IV, complement factor H-related protein 4 and platelet basic protein - demonstrated the best classification performance for our data. In addition, the apolipoprotein group resulted in strong over-representation, thus highlighting these proteins as an additional promising biomarker panel., SIGNIFICANCE: Currently there is no single biochemical parameter available for the accurate diagnosis of growth hormone (GH) deficiency (GHD) in children. Simple GH measurements are not an option: because GH is released in a pulsatile action, its blood levels fluctuate throughout the day and remain nearly undetectable for most of that time. This makes measurements of GH in a single blood sample useless for assessing GH deficiency. Actually, the diagnosis of GHD includes a combination of direct and indirect non-accurate measurements, such as taking several body measurements, testing GH levels in multiple blood samples after provocative tests (GH peak <7.3ng/mL, using radioimmunoassay), and conducting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), among others. Therefore, there is a need for simple, non-invasive, accurate and cost-effective biomarkers. Here we report a case-control study, where relative abundance of serum proteins were measured by next-generation proteomics SWATH-MS technology in 15 GHD children and 15healthy controls matched by age, sex, and not receiving any treatment. Data generated was analysed by machine learning feature selection algorithms. 263 proteins could be confidently detected and quantified on each sample. The top 10 serum protein biomarker candidates could be identified after applying a feature selection data analysis. The combination of three proteins, apolipoprotein A-IV, complement factor H-related protein 4 and platelet basic protein, showed the best classification performance for our data. In addition, the fact that the pathway and GO analysis we performed pointed to the apolipoproteins as over-represented highlights this protein group as an additional promising biomarker panel for the diagnosis of GHD and for treatment evaluation.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of desvenlafaxine versus placebo in the treatment of children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD)., METHODS: Outpatient children (7-11 years) and adolescents (12-17 years) who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD and had screening and baseline Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) total scores >40 were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of treatment with placebo, low exposure desvenlafaxine (20, 30, or 35 mg/day based on baseline weight), or higher exposure desvenlafaxine (25, 35, or 50 mg/day based on baseline weight). The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in CDRS-R total score at week 8, analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Secondary efficacy assessments included Clinical Global Impressions-Severity and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scales. Safety assessments included adverse events and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale., RESULTS: The safety population included 363 patients (children, n = 109; adolescents, n = 254). No statistical separation from placebo was observed for either desvenlafaxine group for CDRS-R total score or for any secondary efficacy endpoint. At week 8, adjusted mean (standard error) changes from baseline in CDRS-R total score for the desvenlafaxine low exposure, desvenlafaxine high exposure, and placebo groups were -23.7 (1.1), -24.4 (1.1), and -22.9 (1.1), respectively. The incidence of adverse events was similar among groups., CONCLUSION: Low and high exposure desvenlafaxine groups did not demonstrate efficacy for the treatment of MDD in children and adolescents in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Desvenlafaxine (20-50 mg/day) was generally safe and well tolerated with no new safety signals identified in pediatric patients with MDD in this study.

N2  - Previous studies have reported that effect sizes of antidepressants were larger in two-armed than in three-armed or more-armed (multiarmed) randomized trials, where the probability of being allocated to placebo is lower. However, these studies have not taken into account the publication bias, differences among antidepressants, or covariance in multiarmed studies, or examined sponsorship bias. We searched published and unpublished randomized-controlled trials that compared placebo with 21 antidepressants for the acute treatment of major depression in adults. We calculated the ratio of odds ratios (ROR) of drug response over placebo in two-armed versus multiarmed trials for each antidepressant, and then synthesized RORs across all the included antidepressants using the multivariate meta-analysis. A random-effects model was used throughout. Two hundred and fifty-eight trials (66 two-armed and 192 multiarmed trials; 80 454 patients; 43.0% with unpublished data) were included in the present analyses. The pooled ROR for response of two-armed trials over multiarmed trials was 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 0.96-1.24). The ROR did not materially change between types of antidepressants, publication year, or sponsorship. The differences between two-armed versus multiarmed studies were much smaller than were suggested in previous studies and were not significant.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A growing body of research has analyzed the potential risks of problematic Facebook use for mental health and well-being. The current meta-analysis is the first to examine the associations between problematic Facebook use, psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, etc.) and well-being (life satisfaction, positive mental health) among adolescents and young adults., METHOD: A comprehensive search strategy identified relevant studies in PsychInfo, Pubmed, Scopus, ResearchGate, and Google Scholar., RESULTS: The final sample included 23 independent samples with a total of 13,929 participants (60.7% females; Mage= 21.93, range: 16.5-32.4). Results of random effects meta-analysis confirmed a positive correlation between problematic Facebook use and psychological distress (r = .34, 95% CI [.28, .39]). Moderation analysis revealed that effect sizes were larger in older samples. Moreover, a negative correlation between problematic Facebook use and well-being was observed (r = -.22, 95% CI [-.28, -.15])., LIMITATIONS: All available studies used a cross-sectional design thus hampering the possibility to establish the direction of the association between problematic Facebook use and psychological distress and well-being., CONCLUSIONS: Results are discussed within the extant literature on problematic Facebook use and future research directions are proposed. This research may also inform clinical and prevention interventions on problematic Facebook use. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The rapid growth of urban areas in China in the past few decades has introduced profound changes in family structure and income distribution that could plausibly affect mental health. Although multilevel studies of the influence of area-level socioeconomic factors on mental health have become more common in other parts of the world, a study of this sort has not been carried out in Chinese cities. Our objectives were to examine the associations of two key neighbourhood-level variables-median income and percentage of married individuals living in the neighbourhood-with mental disorders net of individual-level income and marital status in three Chinese cities., SETTING: Household interviews in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, PRC, as part of the cross-sectional World Mental Health Surveys., PARTICIPANTS: 4072 men and women aged 18-88 years., PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime and past-year internalising and externalising mental disorders., RESULTS: Each one-point increase in neighbourhood-level percentage of married residents was associated with a 1% lower odds of lifetime (p=0.024) and 2% lower odds of past-year (p=0.008) individual-level externalising disorder, net of individual-level marital status. When split into tertiles, individuals living in neighbourhoods in the top tertile of percentage of married residents had 54% lower odds of a past-year externalising disorder (OR=0.46, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.87) compared with those in the bottom tertile. Neighbourhood-level marital status was not statistically associated with either lifetime or past-year internalising disorders. Neighbourhood-level income was not statistically associated with odds of either internalising or externalising disorders., CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of married residents in respondents' neighbourhoods was significantly inversely associated with having externalising mental disorders in this sample of Chinese cities. Possible mechanisms for this finding are discussed and related to social causation, social selection and social control theories. Future work should examine these relationships longitudinally.

N2  - A mother's cortisol secretion is importantly associated with her own mental health and her infant's cortisol secretion. This study investigated the influences of maternal history of care and maternal DRD2, SLC6A3, and OXTR genotypes on maternal cortisol in the context of infant stress. A community sample of 296 mother-infant dyads completed a maternal separation at infant age 17 months. Maternal salivary cortisol, buccal cells, and self-reported history of care were collected. Multilevel models revealed that history of care had a greater influence on maternal baseline cortisol (but not cortisol trajectory) for mothers with more plasticity alleles of SLC6A3 (10R) and OXTR (G), relative to mothers with fewer or no plasticity alleles. Findings indicate that a mother's history of care is related to her cortisol secretion in anticipation of infant stress, but that this relation depends on her genetic characteristics. Findings are discussed in relation to the maternal protective system and anticipatory cortisol secretion. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Cissampelos sympodialis Eichl is used in folk medicine for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases; several alkaloids have been isolated from this species and some of them have anti-allergic, immunomodulatory and spasmolytic activities. Treatment of rats with the total tertiary alkaloid fraction showed an antidepressant effect. One of the depression causes can be the deficiency of monoamines, which is a factor displayed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Theoretical studies using in silico methods have aided in the process of drug discovery. From this perspective, we applied ligand-based-virtual associated with structure-based-virtual screening of alkaloids from C. sympodialis Eichl and 101 derivatives proposed by us are promising leads against some important targets (BACE, GSK-3beta and MAO-A). From the ChEMBL database, we selected a diverse set of 724, 1898 and 1934 structures, which had been tested against BACE, GSK-3beta and MAO-A, to create Random Forest (RF) models with good overall prediction rate, over 78%, for cross-validation and test set. Compounds 24 and 47 presented activity against GSK-3beta and MAO-A simultaneously. The natural alkaloids roraimine and simpodialine-beta-N-oxide presented activity against BACE and liriodenine against MAO-A. The top 20 compounds with best docking performance per enzyme were selected and validated through the RF model. All 9 compounds classified as active in RF model for BACE are bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids and were present in the top docking scoring, demonstrating a consensus on results. Affinities of bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids, including two secondary metabolites (roraimine and simpodialine-beta-N-oxide), with BACE suggest that this skeleton can be used as a model to design new antagonists of this enzyme.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To examine the interaction between social income inequality, social integration, and health status among internal migrants (IMs) who migrate between regions in China., METHODS: We used the data from the 2014 Internal Migrant Dynamic Monitoring Survey in China, which sampled 15,999 IMs in eight cities in China. The Gini coefficient at the city level was calculated to measure social income inequality and was categorized into low (0.2 < Gini <= 0.3), medium (0.3 < Gini <= 0.4), high (0.4 < x < = 0.5), and very high (Gini >0.5). Health status was measured based upon self-reported health, subjective well-being, and perceptions of stress and mental health. Social integration was measured from four perspectives (acculturation and integration willingness, social insurance, economy, social communication). Linear mixed models were used to examine the interaction effects between health statuses, social integration, and the Gini coefficient., RESULTS: Factors of social integration, such as economic integration and acculturation and integration willingness, were significantly related to health. Social income inequality had a negative relationship with the health status of IMs. For example, IMs in one city, Qingdao, with a medium income inequality level (Gini = 0.329), had the best health statuses and better social integration. On the other hand, IMs in another city, Shenzhen, who had a large income inequality (Gini = 0.447) were worst in health statues and had worse social integration., CONCLUSION: Policies or programs targeting IMs should support integration willingness, promote a sense of belonging, and improve economic equality. In the meantime, social activities to facilitate employment and create social trust should also be promoted. At the societal level, structural and policy changes are necessary to promote income equity to promote IMs' general health status.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Among the diseases related to oral health, such as caries and oral cancer, dental trauma stands out as one of the major public health problems worldwide. The aim of this study was to verify the occurrence of factors associated with traumatic dental injuries (TDIs), including oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), sociodemographic characteristics, untreated caries, occlusal problems and contextual variables in 12-year-old Brazilian children., METHODS: This study assessed a complex sample of the National Research in Oral Health (SBBrasil 2010) data on 7240 12-year-old children and contextual features of the municipalities where they lived., RESULTS: TDI prevalence in 12-year-old schoolchildren was 23.96%. Being female was a protective factor for all trauma outcome variables. Non-white children were at risk of maxillary tooth fractures. Maxillary overjet greater than 3 mm was associated with all trauma outcomes. Crowding and spacing were risk factors for enamel trauma. TDI has a negative impact on OHRQoL. None of the contextual variables analysed (Gini coefficient, MHDI, family health strategy and water fluoridation) were associated with TDI in the multilevel approach., CONCLUSIONS: TDI was better explained by individual factors, related to sociodemographic conditions and occlusal problems, with a negative impact on OHRQoL, adjusted for untreated caries. Contextual variables were not associated with TDI in 12-year-old Brazilian schoolchildren. Interdisciplinary actions for preventing dental trauma, such as stimulating the use of mouthguards, have to be encouraged by the family health strategy (FHS) and school health programme (SHP).

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Gabapentin has been extensively prescribed off-label for psychiatric indications, with little established evidence of efficacy. Gabapentin and pregabalin, a very similar drug with the same mechanism of action, bind to a subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels which are implicated in the aetiopathogenesis of bipolar disorder, anxiety and insomnia. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to collect and critically appraise all the available evidence about the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin and pregabalin in the treatment of bipolar disorder, insomnia and anxiety., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will include all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reported as double-blind and comparing gabapentin or pregabalin with placebo or any other active pharmacological treatment (any preparation, dose, frequency, route of delivery or setting) in patients with bipolar disorder, anxiety or insomnia. For consideration of adverse effects (tolerability), single-blind or open-label RCTs and non-randomised evidence will also be summarised. The main outcomes will be efficacy (measured as dichotomous and continuous outcome) and acceptability (proportion of patients who dropped out of the allocated treatment). Published and unpublished studies will be sought through relevant database searches, trial registries and websites; all reference selection and data extraction will be conducted by at least 2 independent reviewers. We will conduct a random-effects meta-analysis to synthesise all evidence for each outcome. Heterogeneity between studies will be investigated by the I2 statistic. Data from included studies will be entered into a funnel plot for investigation of small-study effects. No subgroup analysis will be undertaken, but we will carry out sensitivity analyses about combination treatment, psychiatric comorbidity, use of rescue medications and fixed versus random-effects model., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This review does not require ethical approval. This protocol has been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42016041802). The results of the systematic review will be disseminated via publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of relative income deprivation (RID) with perceived happiness and self-rated health in Hong Kong., METHODS: We measured RID on Yitzhaki indices constructed using multiple reference groups and used multilevel ordinal logistic regression models to assess its linkages with the two outcomes, using data from 6272 respondents from a large-scale representative household survey., RESULTS: Among the overall population, increased RID was found to be consistently associated with reduced perceived happiness, even after adjusting for respondents' level of absolute income and other socio-demographic covariates; however, there were no consistent associations between RID and self-rated health. In subgroup analysis, we observed significant linkages between RID and self-rated health only among men, the middle and older age ranges, and among those with less education and those not engaged in economic activities., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that RID is adversely associated with perceived happiness. However, its negative linkage with self-rated health is less clear. The weak tie between RID and self-rated health may relate to the Hong Kong context, where the public health system is relatively equitable and has multiple pro-poor health policies.

T1  - A Bayesian meta-analytic approach for safety signal detection in randomized clinical trials.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Meta-analyses are frequently performed on adverse event data and are primarily used for improving statistical power to detect safety signals. However, in the evaluation of drug safety for New Drug Applications, simple pooling of adverse event data from multiple clinical trials is still commonly used. We sought to propose a new Bayesian hierarchical meta-analytic approach based on consideration of a hierarchical structure of reported individual adverse event data from multiple randomized clinical trials., METHODS: To develop our meta-analysis model, we extended an existing three-stage Bayesian hierarchical model by including an additional stage of the clinical trial level in the hierarchical model; this generated a four-stage Bayesian hierarchical model. We applied the proposed Bayesian meta-analysis models to published adverse event data from three premarketing randomized clinical trials of tadalafil and to a simulation study motivated by the case example to evaluate the characteristics of three alternative models., RESULTS: Comparison of the results from the Bayesian meta-analysis model with those from Fisher's exact test after simple pooling showed that 6 out of 10 adverse events were the same within a top 10 ranking of individual adverse events with regard to association with treatment. However, more individual adverse events were detected in the Bayesian meta-analysis model than in Fisher's exact test under the body system "Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders." Moreover, comparison of the overall trend of estimates between the Bayesian model and the standard approach (odds ratios after simple pooling methods) revealed that the posterior median odds ratios for the Bayesian model for most adverse events shrank toward values for no association. Based on the simulation results, the Bayesian meta-analysis model could balance the false detection rate and power to a better extent than Fisher's exact test. For example, when the threshold value of the posterior probability for signal detection was set to 0.8, the false detection rate was 41% and power was 88% in the Bayesian meta-analysis model, whereas the false detection rate was 56% and power was 86% in Fisher's exact test., LIMITATIONS: Adverse events under the same body system were not necessarily positively related when we used "system organ class" and "preferred term" in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities as a hierarchical structure of adverse events. For the Bayesian meta-analysis models to be effective, the validity of the hierarchical structure of adverse events and the grouping of adverse events are critical., CONCLUSION: Our proposed meta-analysis models considered trial effects to avoid confounding by trial and borrowed strength from both within and across body systems to obtain reasonable and stable estimates of an effect measure by considering a hierarchical structure of adverse events.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - A prevailing hypothesis about the association between income inequality and poor health is that inequality intensifies social hierarchies, increases stress, erodes social and material resources that support health, and subsequently harms health. However, the evidence in support of this hypothesis is limited by cross-sectional, ecological studies and a scarcity of developmental studies. To address this limitation, we used pooled, multilevel data from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study to examine lagged, cumulative, and trajectory associations between early-life income inequality and adolescent health and well-being. Psychosomatic symptoms and life satisfaction were assessed in surveys of 11- to 15-year-olds in 40 countries between 1994 and 2014. We linked these data to national Gini indices of income inequality for every life year from 1979 to 2014. The results showed that exposure to income inequality from 0 to 4 years predicted psychosomatic symptoms and lower life satisfaction in females after controlling lifetime mean income inequality, national per capita income, family affluence, age, and cohort and period effects. The cumulative income inequality exposure in infancy and childhood (i.e., average Gini index from birth to age 10) related to lower life satisfaction in female adolescents but not to symptoms. Finally, individual trajectories in early-life inequality (i.e., linear slopes in Gini indices from birth to 10 years) related to fewer symptoms and higher life satisfaction in females, indicating that earlier exposures mattered more to predicting health and wellbeing. No such associations with early-life income inequality were found in males. These results help to establish the antecedent-consequence conditions in the association between income inequality and health and suggest that both the magnitude and timing of income inequality in early life have developmental consequences that manifest in reduced health and well-being in adolescent girls.

N2  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder mainly showed atypical social interaction, communication, and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests and activities. Now clinic diagnosis of ASD is mostly based on psychological evaluation, clinical observation and medical history. All these behavioral indexes could not avoid defects such as subjectivity and reporter-dependency. Therefore researchers devoted themselves to seek relatively stable biomarkers of ASD as supplementary diagnostic evidence. The goal of present study is to generate relatively stable predictive model based on anatomical brain features by using machine learning technique. Forty-six ASD children and thirty-nine development delay children aged from 18 to 37 months were evolved in. As a result, the predictive model generated by regional average cortical thickness of regions with top 20 highest importance of random forest classifier showed best diagnostic performance. And random forest was proved to be the optimal approach for neuroimaging data mining in small size set and thickness-based classification outperformed volume-based classification and surface area-based classification in ASD. The brain regions selected by the models might attract attention and the idea of considering biomarkers as a supplementary evidence of ASD diagnosis worth exploring. Autism Res 2017, 0: 000-000.

N2  - The purpose of this randomized noninferiority trial was to compare video teleconferencing (VTC) versus in-person (IP) delivery of an 8-week acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) intervention among veterans with chronic pain (N = 128) at post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was the pain interference subscale of the Brief Pain Inventory. Secondary outcomes included measures of pain severity, mental and physical health-related quality of life, pain acceptance, activity level, depression, pain-related anxiety, and sleep quality. In intent to treat analyses using mixed linear effects modeling, both groups exhibited significant improvements on primary and secondary outcomes, with the exception of sleep quality. Further, improvements in activity level at 6-month follow-up were significantly greater in the IP group. The noninferiority hypothesis was supported for the primary outcome and several secondary outcomes. Treatment satisfaction was similar between groups; however, significantly more participants withdrew during treatment in the VTC group compared with the IP group, which was moderated by activity level at baseline. These findings generally suggest that ACT delivered via VTC can be as effective and acceptable as IP delivery for chronic pain. Future studies should examine the optimal delivery of ACT for patients with chronic pain who report low levels of activity. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01055639)., PERSPECTIVE: This study suggests that ACT for chronic pain can be implemented via VTC with reductions in pain interference comparable with IP delivery. This article contains potentially important information for clinicians using telehealth technology to deliver psychosocial interventions to individuals with chronic pain.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - PURPOSE: This cross-sectional, population-based study evaluated contextual and individual determinants on the oral health-related quality of life in older Brazilians., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the National Survey of Oral Health were used. The sample was selected by multi-stage probability cluster sampling, with probability proportional to size. The Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (OIDP) was used to evaluate oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). Contextual variables of municipalities and individual variables of older people were included. Descriptive, bivariate and multilevel analyses were conducted., RESULTS: Of the sample of 7619 older Brazilians, 45.7% was impacted by at least one of the OIDP items. The item impact average was 1.2 (95% CI 1.04-1.37). The impact on OHRQoL was lower in older Brazilians residents in municipalities with the highest value of the GINI index (contextual variable) (p = 0.007), among edentulous people (p = 0.001) and dental prosthesis users (p < 0.001). This impact was greater among older people of nonwhite skin color (p = 0.024), lower family income (p = 0.024) and dissatisfied with the oral health (p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of oral problems impacting OHRQoL in older Brazilians was identified. Furthermore, the impact prevalence was related to a positive situation in contextual determinants and a negative situation for the individual, showing a social inequalities profile in relation to individual determinants.

N2  - AIM: In adult medicine, rates of investigation and prescribing appear to be increasing. Such information is lacking for paediatrics. We audited Australian paediatricians' practices in 2013 to determine changes since 2008 in: (i) conditions seen; (ii) consultation duration; (iii) imaging and pathology ordered; and (iv) prescribing., METHODS: This is a patient-level prospective audit of paediatricians' secondary care practice. Between November and December 2013, members of the Australian Paediatric Research Network were invited to complete standardised forms for 100 consecutive patients or all patients seen over 2 weeks, whichever was completed first., MAIN MEASURES: diagnoses, consultation duration, pathology and/or imaging investigations ordered, rate of medication prescription., ANALYSES: hierarchical linear modelling clustered at the paediatrician level., RESULTS: One hundred and eighty paediatricians (48% of those eligible) contributed 7102 consultations. The proportion of developmental/behavioural conditions rose from 48% (SD 31%) to 60% (SD 30%) in new and 54% (SD 28%) to 66% (SD 28%) in review consultations in 2013 compared with 2008. More paediatricians reported diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder (39-56%, P = 0.002), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (47-55%, P = 0.05) and intellectual disability (18-36%, P = 0.001) in first consultations. Mean consultation duration and pathology/imaging ordering rates were stable. Prescribing rates increased from 39 to 45% of consultations for the top 10 new diagnoses and from 57 to 68% of consultations for the top 10 review diagnoses., CONCLUSIONS: Paediatricians are seeing more children with developmental-behavioural conditions, prescribing more and demonstrating wide variation in their practice. The latter suggests both over- and under-treatment. Copyright Â© 2016 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians).

N2  - Children with ADHD demonstrate increased frequent "lapses" in performance on tasks in which the stimulus presentation rate is externally controlled, leading to increased variability in response times. It is less clear whether these lapses are also evident during performance on self-paced tasks, e.g., rapid automatized naming (RAN), or whether RAN inter-item pause time variability uniquely predicts reading performance. A total of 80 children aged 9 to 14 years-45 children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 35 typically developing (TD) children-completed RAN and reading fluency measures. RAN responses were digitally recorded for analyses. Inter-stimulus pause time distributions (excluding between-row pauses) were analyzed using traditional (mean, standard deviation [SD], coefficient of variation [CV]) and ex-Gaussian (mu, sigma, tau) methods. Children with ADHD were found to be significantly slower than TD children (p < .05) on RAN letter naming mean response time as well as on oral and silent reading fluency. RAN response time distributions were also significantly more variable (SD, tau) in children with ADHD. Hierarchical regression revealed that the exponential component (tau) of the letter-naming response time distribution uniquely predicted reading fluency in children with ADHD (p < .001, DELTAR2 = .16), even after controlling for IQ, basic reading, ADHD symptom severity and age. The findings suggest that children with ADHD (without word-level reading difficulties) manifest slowed performance on tasks of reading fluency; however, this "slowing" may be due in part to lapses from ongoing performance that can be assessed directly using ex-Gaussian methods that capture excessively long response times.

T1  - Relationships Between Deprivation and the Self-Reported Health of Older People in Northern Ireland.
A1  - Doebler, Stefanie

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: There are few studies on relationships between deprivation and the self-reported health of people aged above 64 years, and no studies fully representative of Northern Ireland's older population. This article addresses this gap., METHOD: Deprivation of older people as reported in the 2001 and 2011 Censuses and the relationship with self-reported health are analyzed over a 10-year span using multilevel modeling. The data are from the Northern Ireland Longitudinal Study (NILS) linked to 2001-2011 Census returns. Deprivation measures include housing tenure; property value; access to a car; and educational, employment, and area-level income deprivation., RESULTS: Older people suffering deprivation face a significant health disadvantage over a 10-year time span., DISCUSSION: This health disadvantage is stronger in men than in women, likely due to conservative gender roles that are prevalent among Northern Ireland's older population, leading to psychological distress especially among deprived men. The analysis found strongly significant area-level effects, aggravating the health impact of deprivation.

N2  - Research suggests that income inequality may detrimentally affect mental health. We examined the relationship between district-level income inequality and depressive symptoms among individuals in South Africa-one of the most unequal countries in the world-using longitudinal data from Wave 1 (2008) and Wave 3 (2012) of the National Income Dynamics Study. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression Short Form while district Gini coefficients were estimated from census and survey sources. Age, African population group, being single, being female, and having lower household income were independently associated with higher depressive symptoms. However, in longitudinal, fixed-effects regression models controlling for several factors, district-level Gini coefficients were not significantly associated with depressive symptoms scores. Our results do not support the hypothesis of a causal link between income inequality and depressive symptoms in the short-run. Possible explanations include the high underlying levels of inequality in all districts, or potential lags in the effect of inequality on depression. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Many antidepressants are indicated for the treatment of major depression. Two network meta-analyses have provided the most comprehensive assessments to date, accounting for both direct and indirect comparisons; however, these reported conflicting interpretation of results. Here, we present a protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis aimed at updating the evidence base and comparing all second-generation as well as selected first-generation antidepressants in terms of efficacy and acceptability in the acute treatment of major depression., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will include all randomised controlled trials reported as double-blind and comparing one active drug with another or with placebo in the acute phase treatment of major depression in adults. We are interested in comparing the following active agents: agomelatine, amitriptyline, bupropion, citalopram, clomipramine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, levomilnacipran, milnacipran, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, trazodone, venlafaxine, vilazodone and vortioxetine. The main outcomes will be the proportion of patients who responded to or dropped out of the allocated treatment. Published and unpublished studies will be sought through relevant database searches, trial registries and websites; all reference selection and data extraction will be conducted by at least two independent reviewers. We will conduct a random effects network meta-analysis to synthesise all evidence for each outcome and obtain a comprehensive ranking of all treatments. To rank the various treatments for each outcome, we will use the surface under the cumulative ranking curve and the mean ranks. We will employ local as well as global methods to evaluate consistency. We will fit our model in a Bayesian framework using OpenBUGS, and produce results and various checks in Stata and R. We will also assess the quality of evidence contributing to network estimates of the main outcomes with the GRADE framework., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This review does not require ethical approval., PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42012002291.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Poor body image is a public health issue. Mothers are a key influence on adolescent girls' body image. This study evaluated an accessible, scalable, low-intensity internet-based intervention delivered to mothers (Dove Self Esteem Project Website for Parents) on mothers' and their adolescent daughters' body image and psychosocial well-being., METHOD: British mother-daughter dyads (N = 235) participated in a cluster randomized controlled trial (assessment-only control; mothers viewed the website without structured guidance [website-unstructured]; mothers viewed the website via a tailored pathway [website-tailored]). Dyads completed standardized self-report measures of body image, related risk factors, and psychosocial outcomes at baseline, 2 weeks post-exposure, 6-week, and 12-month follow-up., RESULTS: Dyadic models showed that relative to the control, mothers who viewed the website reported significantly higher self-esteem at post-exposure (website-tailored), higher weight esteem at 6-week follow-up (website-tailored), lower negative affect at 12-month follow-up (website-tailored), engaged in more self-reported conversations with their daughters about body image at post-exposure and 6-week follow-up, and were 3-4.66 times more likely to report seeking additional support for body image issues at post-exposure (website-tailored), 6-week, and 12-month (website-tailored) follow-up. Daughters whose mothers viewed the website had higher self-esteem and reduced negative affect at 6-week follow-up. There were no differences on daughters' body image, and risk factors among mothers or daughters, at post-exposure or follow-up. Tailoring website content appeared beneficial., CONCLUSIONS: This intervention offers a promising 'first-step' toward improving psychosocial well-being among mothers and daughters. In order to further optimize the intervention, future research to improve body image-related outcomes and to understand mechanisms for change would be beneficial.

N2  - Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a lipophilic redox molecule that is present in membranes of almost all cells in human tissues. CoQ10 is, amongst other functions, essential for the respiratory transport chain and is a modulator of inflammatory processes and gene expression. Rare monogenetic CoQ10 deficiencies show noticeable symptoms in tissues (e.g. kidney) and cell types (e.g. neurons) with a high energy demand. To identify common genetic variants influencing serum CoQ10 levels, we performed a fixed effects meta-analysis in two independent cross-sectional Northern German cohorts comprising 1300 individuals in total. We identified two genome-wide significant susceptibility loci. The best associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was rs9952641 (P value = 1.31 x 10 -8, beta = 0.063, CI0.95 [0.041, 0.085]) within the COLEC12 gene on chromosome 18. The SNP rs933585 within the NRXN-1 gene on chromosome 2 also showed genome wide significance (P value = 3.64 x 10 -8, beta = -0.034, CI0.95 [-0.046, -0.022]). Both genes have been previously linked to neuronal diseases like Alzheimer's disease, autism and schizophrenia. Among our 'top-10' associated variants, four additional loci with known neuronal connections showed suggestive associations with CoQ10 levels. In summary, this study demonstrates that serum CoQ10 levels are associated with common genetic loci that are linked to neuronal diseases. Copyright Â© The Author 2016.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although recent evidence has shown that area-level income inequality is related to increased risk for depression among adults, few studies have tested this association among adolescents., METHODS: We analysed the cross-sectional data from a sample of 1878 adolescents living in 38 neighbourhoods participating in the 2008 Boston Youth Survey. Using multilevel linear regression modelling, we: (1) estimated the association between neighbourhood income inequality and depressive symptoms, (2) tested for cross-level interactions between sex and neighbourhood income inequality and (3) examined neighbourhood social cohesion as a mediator of the relationship between income inequality and depressive symptoms., RESULTS: The association between neighbourhood income inequality and depressive symptoms varied significantly by sex, with girls in higher income inequality neighbourhood reporting higher depressive symptom scores, but not boys. Among girls, a unit increase in Gini Z-score was associated with more depressive symptoms (beta=0.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.47, p=0.01) adjusting for nativity, neighbourhood income, social cohesion, crime and social disorder. There was no evidence that the association between income inequality and depressive symptoms was due to neighbourhood-level differences in social cohesion., CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of incomes within an urban area adversely affects adolescent girls' mental health; future work is needed to understand why, as well as to examine in greater depth the potential consequences of inequality for males, which may have been difficult to detect here.

N2  - PURPOSE: The Suppression of Ovarian Function trial showed improved disease control for tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression (OFS) compared with tamoxifen alone for the cohort of premenopausal patients who received prior chemotherapy. We present the patient-reported outcomes., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The quality-of-life (QoL) analysis includes 1,722 of 2,045 premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer randomly assigned to receive adjuvant treatment with 5 years of tamoxifen plus OFS or tamoxifen alone. Chemotherapy use before enrollment was optional. Patients completed a QoL form consisting of global and symptom indicators at baseline, every 6 months for 24 months, and annually during years 3 to 6. Differences in the change of QoL from baseline between the two treatments were tested at 6, 24, and 60 months with mixed models for repeated measures with and without chemotherapy and overall., RESULTS: Patients on tamoxifen plus OFS were more affected than patients on tamoxifen alone by hot flushes at 6 and 24 months, by loss of sexual interest and sleep disturbance at 6 months, and by vaginal dryness up to 60 months. Without prior chemotherapy, patients on tamoxifen alone reported more vaginal discharge over the 5 years than patients on tamoxifen plus OFS. Symptom-specific treatment differences at 6 months were less pronounced in patients with prior chemotherapy. Changes in global QoL indicators from baseline were small and similar between treatments over the whole treatment period., CONCLUSION: Overall, OFS added to tamoxifen resulted in worse endocrine symptoms and sexual functioning during the first 2 years of treatment, with variable magnitudes of treatment differences. Short-term differences in symptom-specific QoL, treatment burden, and coping effort between treatment groups were less pronounced for patients with prior chemotherapy, the cohort that benefited most from OFS in terms of disease control.

N2  - Heterogeneity of major depressive disorder (MDD) illness course complicates clinical decision-making. Although efforts to use symptom profiles or biomarkers to develop clinically useful prognostic subtypes have had limited success, a recent report showed that machine-learning (ML) models developed from self-reports about incident episode characteristics and comorbidities among respondents with lifetime MDD in the World Health Organization World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys predicted MDD persistence, chronicity and severity with good accuracy. We report results of model validation in an independent prospective national household sample of 1056 respondents with lifetime MDD at baseline. The WMH ML models were applied to these baseline data to generate predicted outcome scores that were compared with observed scores assessed 10-12 years after baseline. ML model prediction accuracy was also compared with that of conventional logistic regression models. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve based on ML (0.63 for high chronicity and 0.71-0.76 for the other prospective outcomes) was consistently higher than for the logistic models (0.62-0.70) despite the latter models including more predictors. A total of 34.6-38.1% of respondents with subsequent high persistence chronicity and 40.8-55.8% with the severity indicators were in the top 20% of the baseline ML-predicted risk distribution, while only 0.9% of respondents with subsequent hospitalizations and 1.5% with suicide attempts were in the lowest 20% of the ML-predicted risk distribution. These results confirm that clinically useful MDD risk-stratification models can be generated from baseline patient self-reports and that ML methods improve on conventional methods in developing such models.

N2  - Research on aptitude-treatment interactions, or patient characteristics that are associated with better outcome in one treatment than another, can help assign patients to the treatments that will be most personally effective. Theory and one past study suggest that adult attachment style might influence whether depressed patients respond better to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Spurred by inconsistency in past aptitude-treatment interaction research in general, as well as concerns about the reproducibility of psychological research, we sought to replicate and extend the previous study that showed that high attachment avoidance was associated with greater depression reduction in CBT than in IPT and to improve upon that study methodologically. Using longitudinal hierarchical linear modeling, the present study examined whether, among 69 adults randomly assigned to CBT or IPT, rate of change in severity of depression symptoms was predicted by treatment condition, attachment style, and their interaction. We also conducted regression analyses to determine whether posttreatment depression was predicted by the same variables. As expected, CBT and IPT were equivalent in efficacy; however, unlike in the previous trial, there were no moderation effects of attachment. Interestingly, in some analyses, anxious attachment was associated with more positive outcomes and avoidant attachment with more negative outcomes across both treatments. The findings highlight the need for researchers to attempt replications of past studies using methods that might elucidate the reasons for discrepancies in results, and they also suggest that alternative approaches to aptitude-treatment interaction research may be more fruitful.

T1  - Characteristics and heterogeneity of schizoaffective disorder compared with unipolar depression and schizophrenia - a systematic literature review and meta-analysis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Comparisons of illness characteristics between patients with schizoaffective disorder (SAD) patients and unipolar depression (UD) are rare, even though UD is one of the most important differential diagnoses of SAD. Also, the variability of illness characteristics (heterogeneity) has not been compared. We compared illness characteristics and their heterogeneity among SAD, UD, and - as another important differential diagnosis - schizophrenia (S)., METHODS: In order to reduce sampling bias we systematically searched for studies simultaneously comparing samples of patients with SAD, UD, and S. Using random effects and Mantel-Haenszel models we estimated and compared demographic, illness course and psychopathology parameters, using pooled standard deviations as a measurement of heterogeneity., RESULTS: Out of 155 articles found by an earlier meta-analysis, 765 screened in Medline, 2738 screened in EMBASE, and 855 screened in PsycINFO we selected 24 studies, covering 3714 patients diagnosed according to RDC, DSM-III, DSM-IIIR, DSM-IV, or ICD-10. In almost all key characteristics, samples with schizoaffective disorders fell between unipolar depression and schizophrenia, with a tendency towards schizophrenia. On average, UD patients were significantly older at illness onset (33.0 years, SAD: 25.2, S: 23.4), more often women (59% vs. 57% vs. 39%) and more often married (53% vs. 39% vs. 27%). Their psychopathology was also less severe, as measured by BPRS, GAS, and HAMD. In demographic and clinical variables heterogeneity was roughly 5% larger in UD than in SAD, and samples of patients with schizophrenia had the lowest pooled heterogeneity. A similar picture emerged in a sensitivity analysis with coefficient of variation as the measurement of heterogeneity., LIMITATIONS: Relative to bipolar disorder there are fewer studies including unipolar patients. No studies based on DSM-5 could be included., CONCLUSIONS: Regarding unipolar affective disorder this study confirms what we have shown for bipolar disorders in earlier studies: schizoaffective disorder falls between schizophrenia and affective disorders, and there are relevant quantitative differences in key illness characteristics, which supports the validity of the schizoaffective disorder concept. Contrary to our expectations heterogeneity is not larger in SAD than in UD and not substantially higher than in S. Lower reliability of the diagnosis of SAD therefore cannot be ascribed to higher variability of illness characteristics in SAD. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - PURPOSE: This study investigated the relationship between contextual and individual social determinants of oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in Brazilian adults., METHODS: Data of 4594 Brazilian adults aged 35-44 years from the 2010 Brazilian Oral Health Survey were analysed. OHRQoL was measured using the Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (OIDP). Contextual socio-economic characteristics at city level assessed in 1991 and 2000 included social deprivation measured by Human Development Index (HDI) and income inequality (Gini index). Individual socio-economic characteristics included family income, schooling and number of goods. Covariates were age, sex, ethnicity and clinical oral measures. Multilevel multivariable Poisson regression analysis was carried to investigate the association of contextual and individual social characteristics with OIDP extent and with each OIDP item., RESULTS: Eating and cleaning teeth were the most reported daily activities influenced by oral conditions. In the adjusted analysis, low HDI 1991 and individual social characteristics (lower family income and lower schooling) were associated with OIDP extent. Sex (females) and all clinical oral measures were also associated with OIDP. Adults living in the cities with low HDI 1991 were more likely to have impact on eating and sleeping, whereas living in cities with high Gini index 1991 increased the prevalence of impact on emotional status, work and social contact. Low income was associated with all OIDP items., CONCLUSION: Poor contextual social determinants and lower individual socio-economic position are associated with worse OHRQoL among Brazilian adults, even after adjusting for individual socio-demographic and clinical oral health variables.

Four common variants involved in inflammatory-adipokine triggering (IL6 rs2069845, LEPR rs1137100, NAMPT rs3801266, and AMD1 rs2796749) have recently been associated with obesity and related traits in Indian children. The current study aimed to examine the effect of these variants on risk of childhood/juvenile onset obesity and on obesity-related quantitative traits in two Danish cohorts., METHODS: Genotype information was obtained for 1461 young Caucasian men from the Genetics of Overweight Young Adults (GOYA) study (overweight/obese: 739 and normal weight: 722) and the Danish Childhood Obesity Biobank (TDCOB; overweight/obese: 1022 and normal weight: 650). Overweight/obesity was defined as having a body mass index (BMI) >=25 kg/m(2); among children and youths, this cut-off was defined using age and sex-specific cut-offs corresponding to an adult body mass index >=25 kg/m(2). Risk of obesity was assessed using a logistic regression model whereas obesity-related quantitative measures were analyzed using a general linear model (based on z-scores) stratifying on the case status and adjusting for age and gender. Meta-analyses were performed using the fixed effects model., RESULTS: No statistically significant association with childhood/juvenile obesity was found for any of the four gene variants among the individual or combined analyses (rs2069845 OR: 0.94 CI: 0.85-1.04; rs1137100 OR: 1.01 CI: 0.90-1.14; rs3801266: 0.96 CI: 0.84-1.10; rs2796749 OR: 1.02 CI: 0.90-1.15; p > 0.05). However, among normal weight children and juvenile men, the LEPR rs1137100 A-allele significantly associated with lower BMI (beta = -0.12, p = 0.0026)., CONCLUSIONS: The IL6, LEPR, NAMPT, and AMD1 gene variants previously found to associate among Indian children did not associate with risk of obesity or obesity-related quantitative measures among Caucasian children and juvenile men from Denmark.

N2  - UNLABELLED: This study evaluated a 90-min single session school-based body image intervention (Dove Confident Me: Single Session), and investigated if delivery could be task-shifted to teachers. British adolescents (N = 1707; 11-13 years; 50.83% girls) participated in a cluster randomised controlled trial [lessons as usual control; intervention teacher-led (TL); intervention researcher-led (RL)]. Body image, risk factors, and psychosocial and disordered eating outcomes were assessed 1-week pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, and 4-9.5 weeks follow-up. Multilevel mixed-models showed post-intervention improvements for intervention students relative to control in body esteem (TL; girls only), negative affect (TL), dietary restraint (TL; girls only), eating disorder symptoms (TL), and life engagement (TL; RL). Awareness of sociocultural pressures increased at post-intervention (TL). Effects were small-medium in size (ds 0.19-0.76) and were not maintained at follow-up. There were no significant differences between conditions at post or follow-up on body satisfaction, appearance comparisons, teasing, appearance conversations and self-esteem. The intervention had short-term benefits for girls' body image and dietary restraint, and for eating disorder symptoms and some psychosocial outcomes among girls and boys. A multi-session version of the intervention is likely to be necessary for sustained improvements. Teachers can deliver this intervention effectively with minimal training, indicating broader scale dissemination is feasible., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN16782819. Copyright Â© 2015 The Authors.

T1  - Which part of community social capital is related to life satisfaction and self-rated health? A multilevel analysis based on a nationwide mail survey in Japan.

N2  - This paper aims to clarify the association between various social capital components at the municipal level (community social capital) and two quality-of-life factors at the individual level [individual self-rated life satisfaction and self-rated health (SRH)] based on data from a nationwide social capital survey that the authors carried out in 2013 in Japan (N = 3406 in 99 municipalities). The survey covers residents in Japan between the ages of 20 and 79 years. We focus on both contextual social capital and household income inequality in terms of the Gini coefficient at the municipality level since, to the best of our knowledge, no paper has explicitly dealt with municipalities in Japan as the units of contextual social capital and the Gini. Our analyses show that the subjective life satisfaction of individuals, after controlling for socioeconomic status and health at the individual level, is associate with both an income gap and social capital at the municipal level. Every component of community social capital in this study except for generalized reciprocity, both cognitive (generalized trust, particularized trust, and particularized reciprocity), and structural (three types of group participation and daily contacts with neighbors, friends/acquaintances, and colleagues), and the Gini coefficient on earned income were associated with self-rated life satisfaction at the individual level with statistical significance. However, SRH is associated only with cognitive social capital at the community level. SRH has no significant association with structural components of community social capital or with a community income gap in terms of the Gini coefficient on personal income. Judging from the results of estimates in the study, most of the components of community social capital at the municipal level seem to play an important role in enhancing self-rated life satisfaction. Life satisfaction may be associated with the broad atmosphere of the municipal level where one resides, while SRH is associated with cognitive social capital rather than structural social capital. However, the difference in the impact of contextual social capital between the two QOL indices may indicate the importance of considering a proper contextual level that is suitable for the outcome.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The effects of anti-dementia drugs on gait performance in Alzheimer disease (AD) are questionable. The objective of this meta-analysis was to examine the effects of anti-dementia drugs on the mean value and the coefficient of variation (CoV) of stride time among patients with AD while taking into account the type of drugs (i.e., acetylcholinesterase inhibitors [AChEIs] versus memantine) and the walking conditions (i.e., single versus dual-task)., METHODS: An English and French Medline search was conducted in March 2015, with no limit of date, using the Medical Subject Headings terms "pharmaceutical preparations" combined with terms "Pharmaceutical preparations" OR "Therapeutic uses" OR "Drug substitution" OR "Drugs essential" OR "Drugs, Generic" OR "Psychotropic drugs" combined with "Delirium" OR "Dementia" OR "Amnestic" OR "Cognitive disorders" AND "Gait" OR "Gait Ataxia" OR "Gait disorders, Neurologic" OR "Gait apraxia". Fixed-effects meta-analyses were used to examine anti-dementia drugs-related changes in mean value and CoV of stride time., RESULTS: Of the 66 identified abstracts, 5 (7.6%) were included in the meta-analysis. Inter-group comparison of between-visit change underscored a significant decrease in CoV of stride time (P<0.004) in intervention group compared to control group, whatever the pooled analysis considered, but no significant change in the mean value (P>0.06). Intra-group changes in stride time parameters following the use of anti-dementia drugs showed a significant decrease for memantine (P<0.001) and while pooling AChEIs and memantine (P<0.001) under single task condition. Under dual task condition, only AChEIs improved significantly stride time parameters (P=0.002)., CONCLUSION: Anti-dementia drugs demonstrated a significant improvement of gait performance with specific class effect depending on the walking conditions and on the type of stride time parameters considered.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The combined efficacy analysis of the TEXT and SOFT trials showed a significant disease-free survival benefit with exemestane plus ovarian function suppression (OFS) compared with tamoxifen plus OFS. We present patient-reported outcomes from these trials., METHODS: Between Nov 7, 2003, and April 7, 2011, 4717 premenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer were enrolled in TEXT or SOFT to receive unmasked adjuvant treatment with 5 years of exemestane plus OFS or tamoxifen plus OFS. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue triptorelin, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral ovarian irradiation were used to achieve OFS. Chemotherapy use was optional. Randomisation with permuted blocks was done with the International Breast Cancer Study Group's internet-based system and was stratified by chemotherapy use and status of lymph nodes. Patients completed a quality of life (QoL) form comprising several global and symptom indicators at baseline, every 6 months for 24 months, and then every year during years 3 to 6. Differences in the change of QoL from baseline between the two treatments were tested at 6 months, 24 months, and 60 months with mixed-models for repeated measures for each trial with and without chemotherapy and overall. The analysis was by intention to treat. At the time of analysis, the median follow-up was 5.7 years (IQR 3.7-6.9); treatment and follow-up of patients continue. The trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, as NCT00066703 (TEXT) and NCT00066690 (SOFT)., FINDINGS: Patients on tamoxifen plus OFS were more affected by hot flushes and sweats over 5 years than were those on exemestane plus OFS, although these symptoms improved. Patients on exemestane plus OFS reported more vaginal dryness, greater loss of sexual interest, and difficulties becoming aroused than did patients on tamoxifen plus OFS; these differences persisted over time. An increase in bone or joint pain was more pronounced, particularly in the short term, in patients on exemestane plus OFS than patients on tamoxifen plus OFS. Changes in global QoL indicators from baseline were small and similar between treatments over the 5 years., INTERPRETATION: Overall, from a QoL perspective, there is no strong indication to favour either exemestane plus OFS or tamoxifen plus OFS. The distinct effects of the two treatments on the burden of endocrine symptoms need to be addressed with patients individually., FUNDING: Pfizer, International Breast Cancer Study Group, and US National Cancer Institute.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The main purpose of this study was to identify age-related socioeconomic and clinical determinants of quality of life among breast cancer survivors five years after the diagnosis. The secondary objective was to describe quality of life in the studied population according to age., STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey in five-year breast cancer survivors was conducted in women diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007 and 2008 in Cote d'Or., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality of life was assessed with the SF-12, the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and the EORTC-QLQ-BR23 questionnaires. Socio-economic deprivation was assessed by the EPICES questionnaire. Social support was assessed by the Sarason questionnaire and clinical features were collected through the Cote d'Or breast cancer registry. Age-related determinants of quality of life were identified using multivariate mixed model analysis for each SF-12 dimension., RESULTS: Overall 396 women completed the questionnaires. Women aged <65 years had a better quality of life and a greater availability of social support than did women aged >=65 years. Body mass index, relapse and EPICES were found to be determinants of quality of life in younger women (p<0.006). For older women, comorbidities and EPICES deprivation scores were predictors of low quality of life scores (p<0.006)., CONCLUSIONS: Five years after breast cancer diagnosis, disease severity did not affect quality of life. The major determinants of quality of life in younger women were disease relapse and EPICES deprivation scores while those in older women were comorbidities and EPICES deprivation scores.

T1  - Income deprivation and mental well-being: the role of non-cognitive skills.
A1  - Blazquez Cuesta, Maite

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - We show that the positive relation between income deprivation and mental health is affected by an individual's non-cognitive skills. Income deprivation is operationalized as the Yitzhaki index, i.e., as a function of the sum of income differences between an individual and others in her reference group who are more affluent. Non-cognitive skills are extracted from a Locus of Control questionnaire and the Big Five Inventory, a self-report measurement of an individual in regard to five aspects of personality: conscientiousness, neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness and open-mindedness. The results, based on the 2002-2010 waves of the German Socio-Economic Panel dataset (SOEP), show that deprivation is negative and significantly related with mental health. However, neurotic individuals are more deprivation-sensitive than are others. Compared to the mean effect, a one standard deviation rise in neuroticism is associated with a deprivation effect that is 36.6% and 51.9% larger among men and women, respectively. Although to a lesser extent, extraverted men and conscientious women are also found to be more deprivation-sensitive than are others, the corresponding figures being 31.1% and 45.9%, respectively. These findings suggest that personality differences should be taken into account in the design of policies, practices and initiatives aimed at alleviating the well-being costs of income deprivation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional studies suggest that low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) may be a risk factor for depression; however, there are few prospective studies. We examined the association between 25(OH)D and depressive symptoms in community-dwelling persons aged 70-79 years in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study (n = 2598)., METHODS: Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) at baseline and 2-, 3- and 4-year follow-up. Serum 25(OH)D was measured at 1-year follow-up and categorized as <20, 20-<30, and >=30 ng/mL. Mixed models were used to examine change in CES-D scores according to 25(OH)D categories. The association between 25(OH)D categories and incident depression (CES-D short score >=10 or antidepressant medication use) were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Analyses were adjusted for socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics, season, and chronic conditions., RESULTS: Thirty-three percent of participants had 25(OH)D <20ng/mL. Serum 25(OH)D was not associated with CES-D scores at baseline (p = .51); however, CES-D scores increased over time and were significantly associated with 25(OH)D at 2-year (p = .003) and 4-year follow-up (p < .001). Among 2,156 participants free of depression at the 1-year follow-up, the cumulative incidence of depression was 26.9%. Participants with 25(OH)D <20ng/mL were at greater risk of developing depression (HR [95% CI]: 1.65 [1.23-2.22]) over 4 years of follow-up compared with those with 25(OH)D >=30ng/mL., CONCLUSION: Low 25(OH)D was independently associated with a greater increase in depressive symptom scores and incident depression in community-dwelling older adults.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between Black ethnic density and depressive symptoms among African Americans. We sought to ascertain whether a threshold exists in the association between Black ethnic density and an important mental health outcome, and to identify differential effects of this association across social, economic, and demographic subpopulations., METHODS: We analyzed the African American sample (n = 3570) from the National Survey of American Life, which we geocoded to the 2000 US Census. We determined the threshold with a multivariable regression spline model. We examined differential effects of ethnic density with random-effects multilevel linear regressions stratified by sociodemographic characteristics., RESULTS: The protective association between Black ethnic density and depressive symptoms changed direction, becoming a detrimental effect, when ethnic density reached 85%. Black ethnic density was protective for lower socioeconomic positions and detrimental for the better-off categories. The masking effects of area deprivation were stronger in the highest levels of Black ethnic density., CONCLUSIONS: Addressing racism, racial discrimination, economic deprivation, and poor services-the main drivers differentiating ethnic density from residential segregation-will help to ensure that the racial/ethnic composition of a neighborhood is not a risk factor for poor mental health.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Depression is the second most common mental disorder in older adults (OA) worldwide. The ways in which depression is influenced by the social determinants of health - specifically, by socioeconomic deprivation, income inequality and social capital - have been analyzed with only partially conclusive results thus far. The objective of our study was to estimate the association of income inequality and socioeconomic deprivation at the locality, municipal and state levels with the prevalence of depressive symptoms among OA in Mexico., METHODS: Cross-sectional study based on a nationally representative sample of 8,874 OA aged 60 and over. We applied the brief seven-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) to determine the presence of depressive symptoms. Additionally, to select the principal context variables, we used the Deprivation Index of the National Population Council of Mexico at the locality, municipal and state levels, and the Gini Index at the municipal and state levels. Finally, we estimated the association of income inequality and socioeconomic deprivation with the presence of depressive symptoms using a multilevel logistic regression model., RESULTS: Socioeconomic deprivation at the locality (OR = 1.28; p<0.10) and municipal levels (OR = 1.16; p<0.01) correlated significantly with the presence of depressive symptoms, while income inequality did not., CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study confirm that the social determinants of health are relevant to the mental health of OA. Further research is required, however, to identify which are the specific socioeconomic deprivation components at the locality and municipal levels that correlate with depression in this population group.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether the socioeconomic environment was associated with no participation in physical activity among adolescents in Boston, Massachusetts., METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from 1878 urban adolescents living in 38 neighborhoods who participated in the 2008 Boston Youth Survey, a biennial survey of high school students (aged 14-19 years). We used multilevel multiple regression models to determine the association between neighborhood-level exposures of economic deprivation, social fragmentation, social cohesion, danger and disorder, and students' reports of no participation in physical activity in the previous week., RESULTS: High social fragmentation within the residential neighborhood was associated with an increased likelihood of being inactive (odds ratio = 1.53; 95% confidence interval = 1.14, 2.05). No other neighborhood exposures were associated with physical inactivity., CONCLUSIONS: Social fragmentation might be an important correlate of physical inactivity among youths living in urban settings. Interventions might be needed to assist youths living in unstable neighborhoods to be physically active.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation between county-level income inequality and rates of child maltreatment., METHODS: Data on substantiated reports of child abuse and neglect from 2005 to 2009 were obtained from the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System. County-level data on income inequality and children in poverty were obtained from the American Community Survey. Data for additional control variables were obtained from the American Community Survey and the Health Resources and Services Administration Area Resource File. The Gini coefficient was used as the measure of income inequality. Generalized additive models were estimated to explore linear and nonlinear relations among income inequality, poverty, and child maltreatment. In all models, state was included as a fixed effect to control for state-level differences in victim rates., RESULTS: Considerable variation in income inequality and child maltreatment rates was found across the 3142 US counties. Income inequality, as well as child poverty rate, was positively and significantly correlated with child maltreatment rates at the county level. Controlling for child poverty, demographic and economic control variables, and state-level variation in maltreatment rates, there was a significant linear effect of inequality on child maltreatment rates (P < .0001). This effect was stronger for counties with moderate to high levels of child poverty., CONCLUSIONS: Higher income inequality across US counties was significantly associated with higher county-level rates of child maltreatment. The findings contribute to the growing literature linking greater income inequality to a range of poor health and well-being outcomes in infants and children.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The common mental disorders (CMDs) of anxiety and depression are the most common form of poor mental health in the general population. Evidence from the small number of previous cohort studies on the role of neighbourhood factors in mental health is inconclusive. We tested the hypothesis that high levels of neighbourhood social cohesion modify an adverse association between change in individual mental health and neighbourhood deprivation., METHOD: We carried out a longitudinal multilevel analysis using data from the Caerphilly Health and Social Needs Cohort Study with a 7-year follow-up (n = 4426; age range 18-74 years at baseline). Neighbourhood deprivation and neighbourhood social cohesion were assessed at baseline and change in mental health between follow-up and baseline was assessed using the five-item Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5)., RESULTS: Residence in the most deprived neighbourhoods was negatively associated with change in mental health, after adjusting for baseline individual socio-economic risk factors and transitions in life events. This negative effect was significantly reduced in high social cohesion neighbourhoods. The predicted change in mental health score was calculated for the 10th and 90th centiles of the household low-income distribution. The difference between them was -2.8 in the low social cohesion group and 1.1 in the high cohesion group. The difference between the groups was 3.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-7.6]., CONCLUSIONS: The public health burden of poor mental health and mental health inequality could potentially be reduced by strengthening social cohesion in deprived neighbourhoods. This offers a mechanism to address the adverse effect of neighbourhood deprivation on population mental health.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Before outcomes-based measures of quality can be used to compare and improve care, they must be risk-standardized to account for variations in patient characteristics. Despite the importance of health-related quality of life (HRQL) outcomes among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), no risk-standardized models have been developed., METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed disease-specific HRQL using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire at baseline and 1 year later in 2693 unselected AMI patients from 24 hospitals enrolled in the Translational Research Investigating Underlying disparities in acute Myocardial infarction Patients' Health status (TRIUMPH) registry. Using 57 candidate sociodemographic, economic, and clinical variables present on admission, we developed a parsimonious, hierarchical linear regression model to predict HRQL. Eleven variables were independently associated with poor HRQL after AMI, including younger age, previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery, depressive symptoms, and financial difficulties (R(2)=20%). The model demonstrated excellent internal calibration and reasonable calibration in an independent sample of 1890 AMI patients in a separate registry, although the model slightly overpredicted HRQL scores in the higher deciles. Among the 24 TRIUMPH hospitals, 1-year unadjusted HRQL scores ranged from 67-89. After risk-standardization, HRQL score variability narrowed substantially (range=79-83), and the group of hospital performance (bottom 20%/middle 60%/top 20%) changed in 14 of the 24 hospitals (58% reclassification with risk-standardization)., CONCLUSIONS: In this predictive model for HRQL after AMI, we identified risk factors, including economic and psychological characteristics, associated with HRQL outcomes. Adjusting for these factors substantially altered the rankings of hospitals as compared with unadjusted comparisons. Using this model to compare risk-standardized HRQL outcomes across hospitals may identify processes of care that maximize this important patient-centered outcome.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Although cross-sectional and ecological studies have shown that higher area-level income inequality is related to increased risk for depression, few longitudinal studies have been conducted. This investigation examines the relationship between state-level income inequality and major depression among adults participating in a population-based, representative longitudinal study., METHODS: We used data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (n=34 653). Respondents completed structured diagnostic interviews at baseline (2001-2002) and follow-up (2004-2005). Weighted multilevel modelling was used to determine if U.S. state-level income inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient) was a significant predictor of depression at baseline and at follow-up, while controlling for individual-level and state-level covariates. We also repeated the longitudinal analyses, excluding those who had a history of depression or at baseline, in order to test whether income inequality was related to incident depression., RESULTS: State-level inequality was associated with increased incidence of depression among women but not men. In comparison to women residing in states belonging to the lowest quintile of income inequality, women were at increased risk for depression in the second (OR=1.18, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.62), third (OR=1.22, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.62), fourth (OR=1.37, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.82) and fifth (OR=1.50, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.96) quintiles at follow-up (p<0.05 for the linear trend)., CONCLUSIONS: Living in a state with higher income inequality increases the risk for the development of depression among women.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Income inequality is associated with numerous negative health outcomes. There is evidence that ecological-level socio-environmental factors may increase risk for schizophrenia., AIMS: The aim was to investigate whether measures of income inequality are associated with incidence of schizophrenia at the country level., METHOD: We conducted a systematic review of incidence rates for schizophrenia, reported between 1975 and 2011. For each country, national measures of income inequality (Gini coefficient) along with covariate risk factors for schizophrenia were obtained. Multi-level mixed-effects Poisson regression was performed to investigate the relationship between Gini coefficients and incidence rates of schizophrenia controlling for covariates., RESULTS: One hundred and seven incidence rates (from 26 countries) were included. Mean incidence of schizophrenia was 18.50 per 100,000 (SD = 11.9; range = 1.7-67). There was a significant positive relationship between incidence rate of schizophrenia and Gini coefficient (beta = 1.02; Z = 2.28; p = .02; 95% CI = 1.00, 1.03)., CONCLUSIONS: Countries characterized by a large rich-poor gap may be at increased risk of schizophrenia. We suggest that income inequality impacts negatively on social cohesion, eroding social capital, and that chronic stress associated with living in highly disparate societies places individuals at risk of schizophrenia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Anti-dementia drugs may improve gait performance. No comparison between acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (CEIs) and memantine-related changes in gait variability has been reported. The objectives of this study were to 1) quantify and compare the mean values and coefficients of variation (CoV) of stride time in demented patients with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) before and after the use of CEIs or memantine, and in age- and gender-matched controls patients with ADRD using no anti-dementia drugs; and 2) to determine whether changes in CoV of stride time differed between CEIs or memantine., METHODS: A total of 120 demented patients with mild-to-moderate ADRD were prospectively included in this pre-post quasi-experimental study with two intervention groups (43 patients taking CEIs, and 41 taking memantine) and a control group (36 age- and gender matched patients without any anti-dementia drugs). CoV of stride time and walking speed were measured with GAITRite R system while usual walking at steady state. Age, gender, number of drugs daily taken, use of psychoactive drugs, body mass index and time between the two visits were also recorded., RESULTS: There was no difference between groups for the time between baseline and follow-up assessments (232.9 +/- 103.7 days for patients without anti-dementia drugs, 220.0 +/- 67.5 days for patients with CEIs, 186.7 +/- 96.2 days for patients with memantine, P = 0.062). Patients with memantine had a lower (i.e., better) CoV of stride time at follow-up assessment compared to those with CEIs (4.2 +/- 2.4% versus 5.8 +/- 4.2%, P = 0.010). Patients with memantine had a greater decrease in CoV of stride time compared to those with CEIs (-1.90% versus 0.93%, P = 0.010) and mixed-effects linear regressions showed that this decrease was specifically explained by memantine (P = 0.028)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that patients with ADRD and treated with memantine, but not those with CEIs, decreased their gait variability, and thus improved their gait safety (Trial registration number: NCT01315704).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To conduct a proof-of-concept randomized trial of an Internal Family Systems (IFS) psychotherapeutic intervention on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity and psychological status., METHODS: Patients with RA were randomized to either an IFS group for 9 months (n = 39) or an education (control) group (n = 40) that received mailed materials on RA symptoms and management. The groups were evaluated every 3 months until intervention end and 1 year later. Self-assessed joint pain (RA Disease Activity Index joint score), Short Form-12 physical function score, visual analog scale for overall pain and mental health status (Beck Depression Inventory, and State Trait Anxiety Inventory) were assessed. The 28-joint Disease Activity Score-C-reactive Protein 4 was determined by rheumatologists blinded to group assignment. Treatment effects were estimated by between-group differences, and mixed model repeated measures compared trends between study arms at 9 months and 1 year after intervention end., RESULTS: Of 79 participants randomized, 68 completed the study assessments and 82% of the IFS group completed the protocol. Posttreatment improvements favoring the IFS group occurred in overall pain [mean treatment effects -14.9 (29.1 SD); p = 0.04], and physical function [14.6 (25.3); p = 0.04]. Posttreatment improvements were sustained 1 year later in self-assessed joint pain [-0.6 (1.1); p = 0.04], self-compassion [1.8 (2.8); p = 0.01], and depressive symptoms [-3.2 (5.0); p =0.01]. There were no sustained improvements in anxiety, self-efficacy, or disease activity., CONCLUSION: An IFS-based intervention is feasible and acceptable to patients with RA and may complement medical management of the disease. Future efficacy trials are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00869349.

T1  - Housing affordability and mental health: does the relationship differ for renters and home purchasers?.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - There is increasing evidence of a direct association between unaffordable housing and poor mental health, over and above the effects of general financial hardship. Type of housing tenure may be an important factor in determining how individuals experience and respond to housing affordability problems. This study investigated whether a relationship exists between unaffordable housing and mental health that differs for home purchasers and private renters among low-income households. Data from 2001 to 2010 of the longitudinal Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey were analysed using fixed-effects linear regression to examine change in the SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS) score of individuals aged 25-64 years, associated with changes in housing affordability, testing for an interaction with housing tenure type. After adjusting for age, survey year and household income, among individuals living in households in the lower 40% of the national income distribution, private renters in unaffordable housing experienced somewhat poorer in mental health than when their housing was affordable (difference in MCS = -1.18 or about 20% of one S.D. of the MCS score; 95% CI: -1.95,-0.41; p = 0.003) while home purchasers experienced no difference on average. The statistical evidence for housing tenure modifying the association between unaffordable housing and mental health was moderate (p = 0.058). When alternatives to 40% were considered as income cut-offs for inclusion in the sample, evidence of a difference between renters and home purchasers was stronger amongst households in the lowest 50% of the income distribution (p = 0.020), and between the 30th and 50th percentile (p = 0.045), with renters consistently experiencing a decline in mental health while mean MCS scores of home purchasers did not change. In this study, private renters appeared to be more vulnerable than home purchasers to mental health effects of unaffordable housing. Such a modified effect suggests that tenure-differentiated policy responses to poor housing affordability may be appropriate. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - "Safe Going": the influence of crime rates and perceived crime and safety on walking in deprived neighbourhoods.
A1  - Mason, Phil
A1  - Kearns, Ade
A1  - Livingston, Mark
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Few studies have simultaneously examined the relationship of levels of recorded crime, perceptions of crime and disorder, and safety from crime with rates of physical activity. We developed a series of multilevel ordinal regression models to examine these aspects in relation to self-reported neighbourhood walking frequency in a cross-sectional sample of 3824 British adults from 29 deprived neighbourhoods in Glasgow, UK. Perceptions of several serious local antisocial behaviours (drunkenness and burglary) and feelings of personal safety (feeling safe in the home and if walking alone in the local area at night) were consistently associated, respectively, with less and more frequent walking. Conversely, perceiving drug dealing or drug use as a serious problem was associated with walking more frequently. There was a small but significant association between walking frequency in neighbourhoods with higher recorded person crime (but not property crime) rates when considered in conjunction with other aspects of disorder and crime safety, although not when additionally controlling for sociodemographic, neighbourhood and community aspects. The magnitude of these objective and perceived crime-related effects is modest and features of the psychosocial environment and social cohesion (having a sense of progress from living in the neighbourhood, group participation and positively rating social venues), as well as health and personal income deprivation, may more strongly determine levels of neighbourhood walking. Nevertheless, physical activity benefits may accrue at the population level through provision of environments that are safer from crime. Our study also shows the importance to local walking of neighbourhood management, which reduces problems of disorder, and of social regeneration, which helps strengthen sense of community.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Common mental disorders are more prevalent in areas of high neighbourhood socioeconomic deprivation but whether the prevalence varies with neighbourhood income inequality is not known., AIMS: To investigate the hypothesis that the interaction between small-area income deprivation and income inequality was associated with individual mental health., METHOD: Multilevel analysis of population data from the Welsh Health Survey, 2003/04-2010. A total of 88,623 respondents aged 18-74 years were nested within 50,587 households within 1887 lower super output areas (neighbourhoods) and 22 unitary authorities (regions), linked to the Gini coefficient (income inequality) and the per cent of households living in poverty (income deprivation). Mental health was measured using the Mental Health Inventory MHI-5 as a discrete variable and as a 'case' of common mental disorder., RESULTS: High neighbourhood income inequality was associated with better mental health in low-deprivation neighbourhoods after adjusting for individual and household risk factors (parameter estimate +0.70 (s.e. = 0.33), P = 0.036; odds ratio (OR) for common mental disorder case 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.97). Income inequality at regional level was significantly associated with poorer mental health (parameter estimate -1.35 (s.e. = 0.54), P = 0.012; OR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.22)., CONCLUSIONS: The associations between common mental disorders, income inequality and income deprivation are complex. Income inequality at neighbourhood level is less important than income deprivation as a risk factor for common mental disorders. The adverse effect of income inequality starts to operate at the larger regional level.

N2  - Traditional measures of respiratory function in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are based on maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) and vital capacity (VC). Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) measurements are easily performed by young children with neuromuscular disorders. The clinical value of SNIP in the longitudinal assessment of respiratory weakness remains to be assessed. The objective of the present study was to assess longitudinally the changes in SNIP, PImax and VC with age in DMD children. We hypothesised that their longitudinal assessment would show an earlier decline in SNIP than VC. A 3-year, prospective follow-up, at 6-month intervals of, 33 steroid-naive, 5-20-year-old DMD patients was analysed using a linear mixed model. SNIP measurements were reliable (within-session coefficient of variation 8%). SNIP and VC increased until 10.5 and 12.5 years of age, respectively, and declined thereafter, while PImax did not change with age. SNIP was an earlier marker of decline in respiratory muscle strength (at 10.5 years) than VC (at 12.5 years) in young DMD patients. SNIP longitudinal assessment is useful in the detection of inspiratory strength decline in young DMD patients when VC values remain within normal values and as an outcome measure in clinical trials for emerging therapeutics in young DMD patients from the age of 5 years.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are steadily increasing worldwide with the greatest prevalence occurring in high-income countries. Many factors influence body mass index (BMI); however multiple influences assessed in families and individuals are rarely studied together in a prospective design. Our objective was to model the impact of multiple influences at the child (low birth weight, history of maltreatment, a history of childhood mental and physical conditions, and school difficulties) and family level (parental income and education, parental mental and physical health, and family functioning) on BMI in early adulthood., METHODS: We used data from the Ontario Child Health Study, a prospective, population-based study of 3,294 children (ages 4-16 years) enrolled in 1983 and followed up in 2001 (N = 1,928; ages 21-35 years). Using multilevel models, we tested the association between family and child-level variables and adult BMI after controlling for sociodemographic variables and health status in early adulthood., RESULTS: At the child level, presence of psychiatric disorder and school difficulties were related to higher BMI in early adulthood. At the family level, receipt of social assistance was associated with higher BMI, whereas family functioning, having immigrant parents and higher levels of parental education were associated with lower BMI. We found that gender moderated the effect of two risk factors on BMI: receipt of social assistance and presence of a medical condition in childhood. In females, but not in males, the presence of these risk factors was associated with higher BMI in early adulthood., CONCLUSION: Overall, these findings indicate that childhood risk factors associated with higher BMI in early adulthood are multi-faceted and long-lasting. These findings highlight the need for preventive interventions to be implemented at the family level in childhood.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Evidence-based Practice (EBP) implementation is likely to be most efficient and effective in organizations with positive social contexts (i.e., organizational culture, climate, and work attitudes of clinicians). The study objective was to test whether an organizational intervention labeled Availability, Responsiveness and Continuity (ARC) could improve the organizational social contexts of community-based mental health programs for youth., METHOD: The study randomly assigned 26 community-based mental health programs for youth to ARC or control conditions. The organizational cultures, climates, and work attitudes of clinicians (n = 197) in the programs were assessed with the Organizational Social Context (OSC) measure for mental health services at baseline and following the 18-month ARC intervention., RESULTS: Hierarchical linear models (HLM) analyses indicated that organizational culture, climate, and work attitudes were significantly improved in the ARC condition after 18 months. Clinicians in programs assigned to ARC reported less rigid, less centralized and less apathetic organizational cultures, more engaged and functional organizational climates with less role conflict, and work attitudes with improved morale, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment., CONCLUSIONS: ARC improved the organizational social contexts of clinicians in community-based mental health programs for youth. Results suggest that organizational intervention strategies can be used to create the types of organizational social contexts that are believed to be necessary for EBP implementation and other service innovations in mental health programs.

N2  - Studies of suicide epidemiology in regions of Australia have been conducted, but the spatial pattern in the whole country has not been fully investigated. This study aimed at visualizing the sex-specific suicide pattern over the country from 2004 to 2008, and studying the metropolitan-rural-remote differentials of suicide across all states/territories. We applied a Poisson hierarchical model to yield smoothed sex specific, age standardized mortality ratios of suicide in all postal areas, and compiled the age-standardized suicide rates across different levels of remoteness and different jurisdictions. We identified the area variation of suicide risk across states/territories, and metropolitan-rural-remote differential with rates higher in rural and remote areas for males. Spatial clusters of some high risk postal areas were also identified. Socio-economic deprivation, compositional factors, high risks for Indigenous people and low access to mental health service are the underlying explanations of the elevation of suicide risk in some areas. These findings suggest that it is important to take geographical variations in suicide risk into account in national policy making. Particular suicide prevention interventions might be targeted at males living in remote areas, and some localized areas in metropolitan zones. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: * Remifentanil, an intravenous ultra short-acting opioid, depresses central nervous system activity with an increase in the delta band power, and causes beta activation after discontinuation, resulting in a rebound of the processed electroencephalographic parameters, including 95% spectral edge frequency, the canonical univariate parameter and electroencephalographic approximate entropy. * A sigmoid Emax model, in which the highest predicted values of processed electroencephalographic parameters are restricted to the baseline value, cannot describe a rebound of these parameters. * Electroencephalographic approximate entropy correlated well with the remifentanil blood concentration and demonstrated high baseline stability., WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: * A combined effect and tolerance model effectively characterized the time course of the remifentanil effect on the central nervous system, including the rebound which occurred during recovery from the remifentanil effect. * Temporal linear mode complexity was comparable with approximate entropy as a univariate electroencephalographic descriptor of the effect of remifentanil on the central nervous system. AIMS Previously, electroencephalographic approximate entropy (ApEn) effectively described both depression of central nervous system (CNS) activity and rebound during and after remifentanil infusion. ApEn is heavily dependent on the record length. Linear mode complexity, which is algorithmatically independent of the record length, was investigated to characterize the effect of remifentanil on the CNS using the combined effect and tolerance, feedback and sigmoid E(max) models. METHODS The remifentanil blood concentrations and electroencephalographic data obtained in our previous study were used. With the recording of the electroencephalogram, remifentanil was infused at a rate of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 microg kg(-1) min(-1) for 15-20 min. The areas below (AUC(effect) ) or above (AAC(rebound) ) the effect vs. time curve of temporal linear mode complexity (TLMC) and ApEn were calculated to quantitate the decrease of the CNS activity and rebound. The coefficients of variation (CV) of median baseline (E(0)), maximal (E(max)), and individual median E(0) minus E(max) values of TLMC were compared with those of ApEn. The concentration-TLMC relationship was characterized by population analysis using non-linear mixed effects modelling., RESULTS: Median AUC(effect) and AAC(rebound) were 1016 and 5.3 (TLMC), 787 and 4.5 (ApEn). The CVs of individual median E(0) minus E(max) were 35.6, 32.5% (TLMC, ApEn). The combined effect and tolerance model demonstrated the lowest Akaike information criteria value and the highest positive predictive value of rebound in tolerance., CONCLUSIONS: The combined effect and tolerance model effectively characterized the time course of TLMC as a surrogate measure of the effect of remifentanil on the CNS.

N2  - Gait variability has potential utility as a predictive measure of dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD). Current understanding implicates non-dopaminergic pathways. This study investigated the explanatory characteristics of gait variability in PD on and off medication under single and dual task conditions. Fifty people with PD were assessed twice at home (on and off L: -dopa) whilst walking under single and dual task conditions, and variability (coefficient of variation, CV) was calculated for stride time and double limb support (DLS) time. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to identify predictors. The first block of variables included age, gait speed, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), and the second block included motor severity (UPDRS III), executive function (Hayling and Brixton) and attention (Test of Everyday Attention). Motor severity predicted stride time variability and DLS time variability independent of L: -dopa during single task gait. Dual task gait yielded a more complex picture. Depression made a unique contribution of 9.0% on medication and 5.0% off medication to stride time variability, and visual attention and younger age contributed to DLS variability on medication, explaining 3% and 2%, respectively. Motor severity predicted DLS variability off medication, explaining 74% of variance. Different characteristics explain the two measures of gait variability, pointing to different control mechanisms.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - The assessment of positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) by means of the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule has received a remarkable popularity in the social sciences. Using a meta-analytic tool-namely, reliability generalization (RG)-population reliability scores of both scales have been investigated on the basis of a random effects model in 147 studies. Correcting for measurement errors, the results demonstrate moderate to high internal consistency coefficients and variations of the PA and NA reliability scores with regard to time frame instructions, language of items, and sample characteristics. The percentage of PA and NA true score variance differs in subpopulations up to 11%. RG analysis of test-retest coefficients illustrates state-like fluctuations and trait-like stability of both scales. Calculations of the fail-safe number point at the robustness of the results. Applications of RG coefficients compared to single-study coefficients highlight the relevance of population coefficients for research and assessment situations.

N2  - UNLABELLED: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that causes cognitive impairment and dementia in ~30% of patients., OBJECTIVE: Compare metric qualities of Mini-Mental Parkinson (MMP) and scales for outcomes in Parkinson's disease-cognition (SCOPA-COG) with respect to their relative reliability, validity and ability to predict symptoms (mobility, quality of life, social repercussions, and mood) in PD patients. Outpatients (n=123, 78 males/45 females) diagnosed with PD were included in the study. A multilevel (hierarchical) modeling analysis was performed along with tests of reliability and validity to ascertain which of the two models better predicts symptoms related to PD., RESULTS: The MMP differed significantly between patients with Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stages 1, 2 or versus 4/5 (grouped together). The SCOPA-COG showed differences only between patients in H&Y stages 2 versus 4/5. Both scales were dependent on educational background and age. The SCOPA-COG had a higher coefficient of variation (0.303) than the MMP (0.184), indicating that it was the more discriminative of the two., CONCLUSIONS: The SCOPA-COG has some advantages over the MMP, the most important being a greater discriminative ability. Multilevel hierarchical analysis clarified the necessity of stratifying the PD population according to educational background, years of illness, and H&Y stage when using these scales.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the influence of demographic, socioeconomic, health, and contextual factors of the Brazilian federation units on the functional disability of the elderly., METHODS: Cross-sectional study based on data from the 2003 PNAD (Brazilian National Household Survey), of IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) and Ipea (Institute of Applied Economic Research). The sample was composed of 33,515 individuals aged 60 years and older. The dependent variable was functional disability, measured by difficulty in climbing slopes or stairs. The independent variables were divided into two levels: individual (demographic, socioeconomic and health-related characteristics) and contextual (Gini Index and Gross Domestic Product per capita by Brazilian state in 2000). A multinomial and multilevel logistic regression model was utilized in order to estimate the effect of the independent variables on the functional disability of the elderly., RESULTS: Functional disability was associated with demographic, socioeconomic and health factors. At the individual level, sex, level of schooling, income, occupation, self-perception of health and chronic diseases were the factors that were most strongly related to functional disability. At the contextual level, income inequality proved to exert an important influence., CONCLUSIONS: Self-perception of health is the factor that is most strongly related to the functional disability of the elderly in Brazil, followed by chronic diseases. Sex, occupation, level of schooling and income are also highly associated with it. Actions that approach the main factors associated with functional disability can contribute significantly to the well-being and quality of life of the elderly.

N2  - The pathophysiology of depression has been associated to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the use of salivary cortisol measures is increasingly being incorporated into research. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether salivary cortisol differs for patients with depression and control persons. We did a systematic review with sequential meta-analysis and meta-regression according to the PRISMA Statement based on comprehensive database searches for studies of depressed patients compared to control persons in whom salivary cortisol was measured. Twenty case-control studies, including 1354 patients with depression and 1052 control persons were identified. In a random-effects meta-analysis salivary cortisol was increased for depressed patients as compared to control persons on average 2.58 nmol/l (95% C.I.: 0.95-4.21) p=0.002 in the morning and on average 0.27 nmol/l (95% C.I.: 0.03-0.51) p=0.03 in the evening. In a fixed-effects model the mean difference was 0.58 nmol/l (95% C.I.). Study sequential cumulative meta-analyses suggested random error for the finding of this rather small difference between groups. The reference intervals for morning salivary cortisol in depressed patients (0-29 nmol/l) and control persons (1-23 nmol/l) showed substantial overlap suggesting lack of discriminative capacity. These results should be interpreted with caution as the heterogeneity for the morning analysis was large and a funnel plot, suggested presence of bias. Further, in meta-regression analyses higher intra-assay coefficients of variation in cortisol kits (p=0.07) and mean age (p=0.08) were associated with a higher mean difference of morning salivary cortisol between depressed and controls, while gender and depression severity were not. Based on the available studies there is not firm evidence for a difference of salivary cortisol in depressed patients and control persons and salivary cortisol is unable to discriminate between persons with and without depression.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The diversity of definitions of frequent attendance in the literature hampers comparison of their precision, validity, and associated factors., AIM: To examine different definitions of frequent attendance in order to identify the sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with frequent attendance in primary care, according to each definition., DESIGN OF STUDY: One-phase cross-sectional study., SETTING: Seventy-seven primary care centres in Catalonia, Spain., METHOD: A total of 3815 primary care patients were interviewed between October 2005 and March 2006. Three definitions of frequent attendance were tested: (1) frequent attenders as the top 25% and the top 10% consulting patients; (2) frequent attenders as the top 25% and the top 10% consulting patients stratified by age and sex; and (3) frequent attenders as the top 25% and the top 10% consulting patients stratified by the presence of physical/mental conditions (patients with only mental disorders, with only chronic physical conditions, with comorbid conditions, and with no condition). Multilevel logistic regressions were used., RESULTS: The following factors were systematically related to frequent attender status: being on sick leave, being born outside of Spain, reporting mental health problems as the main reason for consulting, and having arthritis/rheumatism, or bronchitis. Major depression was related to frequent attendance in two of the three definitions. The factor 'GP' was related to frequent attendance when the top decile cut-off point was used. The models with a 10% cut-off point were more discriminative than those with a 25% cut-off point: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for models with a 25% cut-off and a 10% cut-off ranged between 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70 to 0.73) and 0.75 (95% CI = 0.74 to 0.77) and between 0.79 (95% CI = 0.78 to 0.81) and 0.85 (95% CI = 0.83 to 0.86), respectively., CONCLUSION: The way frequent attendance is defined is of crucial importance. It is recommended that a more discriminative definition of frequent attendance is used (the top 10%).

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize the population pharmacokinetics of paliperidone after intramuscular administration of its long-acting palmitate ester at various doses and at two different injection sites (deltoid and gluteal muscle)., METHODS: The retrospective analysis included pooled data from 1795 subjects from six phase I trials and five phase II and III trials. A total of 18 530 pharmacokinetic samples with valid concentration timepoints were available for this analysis. Nonlinear mixed-effects modelling of the pooled data was conducted using NONMEM software. The full dataset was divided into an index dataset (model development) and a validation dataset. After validation both the index and validation datasets were combined and the final model was re-run on the full dataset., RESULTS: The concentration-time data for paliperidone following intramuscular administration of its palmitate ester were best fitted to a one-compartment model with first-order elimination. The absorption component of the model allowed a fraction of the dose (f(2)) to enter relatively quickly into the central compartment via a zero-order process. After a lag time, the remaining fraction then entered the systemic circulation via a first-order process. Interindividual variability (IIV) in clearance (CL), central volume of distribution (V(d)) and the absorption rate constant (k(a)) were estimated at a 40%, 69% and 59% coefficient of variation (CV), respectively. The IIV on f(2) for paliperidone absorption via the dual-input process was fitted through logit transformation, and its standard deviation (SD) was 0.064. Similarly, the interoccasion variability (IOV) on CL, V(d) and f(2) was 26% CV, 14% CV and 0.07 SD, respectively. An additive-error model with log-transformed data was used to describe the residual variability (RV), and its SD was 0.22. The final covariate model indicated that the following variables had a significant influence on k(a): sex, age, injection volume (IVOL) and injection site (INJS). Similarly, the following variables had a significant influence on f(2): sex, body mass index (BMI), needle length (NDLL), INJS and IVOL. In addition, CL was related to creatinine clearance (CL(CR)), whereas V(d) was related to BMI and sex., CONCLUSIONS: A dual-absorption pharmacokinetic model best described the complex pharmacokinetics of paliperidone after intramuscular administration of its palmitate ester. These results suggest that the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone palmitate are mostly influenced by BMI, CL(CR), INJS, IVOL and NDLL.

N2  - To show that an individual's health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is not determined only by their personal-level characteristics, but also is socially determined by both physical and social environmental characteristics of their communities. This analysis examined the association of selected county-level indicators on respondents' unhealthy days and assessed the utility of mean unhealthy days for US counties as community health indicators. Data came from the 1999-2001 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. We used multilevel models to calculate the proportion of between-county variation in HRQOL that was explained by county-level contextual variables and examine the causal heterogeneity of some personal-level factors modified by these contextual variables. Counties with worse socioeconomic indicators, high mortality rate, and low life expectancy were associated with higher numbers of unhealthy days. These indicators explained 13-22% variance of county-level physically unhealthy days and 4.5-9.5% variance of county-level mentally unhealthy days. The GINI index, suicide rate, percent uninsured, primary care facilities-to-population ratio, and most county-level demographic and housing indicators also had significant but smaller impact on respondents' unhealthy days. Also, the counties with poorer socioeconomic scores had additional negative HRQOL impact on older persons. This study provides important new empirical information on whether various commonly-measured characteristics of the social environment, which are believed to be social determinants of health, are in fact associated with the perceived physical and mental health of its residents. Our findings provide additional support for the construct validity of county-level HRQOL as a community health indicator.

N2  - The aim of this study was to estimate the association between country income distribution and human development with the 12-month occurrence of major depressive episodes across countries. A total of 251,158 people surveyed by the World Health Organization from 2002 to 2003 from 65 countries were included in the study. The survey contained items for identifying major depressive episodes (MDE) in the previous 12 months, attained education (used as an indicator of individual socioeconomic status) and other demographic information. Income inequality was measured with the Gini index, a national-level indicator; the United Nations human development index (HDI) measured overall country development. Country-level and multilevel linear regression models were utilized to study the associations. We found that moderately developed countries had the lowest adjusted prevalence of MDE followed by high and low developed countries. The Gini index was positively associated with major depressive episodes, but only among high HDI countries. After adjusting for age, gender, marital status, education and HDI, the multilevel prevalence ratio indicated a 4% increase in risk of MDE for a person living in a country associated with a 1% increment in income equality. This finding means, for example, that comparing two highly developed countries, one with low income inequality (Gini=0.25) with another with high income inequality (Gini=0.39), one would expect to see an increase in the prevalence of MDE from 4.0% to 6.2%. These findings raise important questions about the role of income inequality on social forces that can lead to depression.

N2  - Optimal adherence to antiretroviral medications is critical to the effective long-term management of HIV infection. Although prospective memory (ProM; i.e., "remembering to remember") has long been theorized to play an important role in medication adherence, no prior studies have evaluated whether HIV-associated ProM impairment possesses unique predictive value in this regard. Results from this study demonstrate a robust association between ProM impairment and self-reported medication management in 87 HIV-infected persons currently prescribed antiretroviral medications. Specifically, more frequent ProM complaints and performance deficits on both laboratory and semi-naturalistic ProM tasks were all independently related to poorer self-reported medication management. A series of hierarchical regression analyses revealed that HIV-associated ProM impairment accounted for a significant amount of variance in self-reported medication management beyond that which was explained by other factors known to predict nonadherence, including mood disorders, psychosocial variables, environmental structure, and deficits on a traditional battery of neuropsychological tests. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that ProM captures a unique and largely untapped aspect of cognition that is germane to optimal medication adherence. The potential benefits of individualized remediation strategies that are informed by conceptual models of ProM and specifically target medication adherence warrant further exploration.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence indicates an association between cognitive function and physical performance in late life. This study examines the relationship between cognitive function and subsequent gait speed decline among high-functioning older adults., METHODS: Measures of global cognitive function (Modified Mini Mental State Examination [3MS]) and executive control function (ECF) (a clock drawing task [CLOX 1] and the 15-item Executive Interview [EXIT 15]) were obtained in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study in 1999-2000. Gait-speed (meters/second) was assessed over 20 meters at usual pace. Using a mixed model, we assessed the relationship between baseline cognitive function and gait-speed change over 3 years., RESULTS: Two thousand, three hundred forty-nine older adults (mean age 75.6 +/- 2.9 years) completed the assessments. After adjustment for baseline gait speed, a 1-standard-deviation (SD) lower performance on each cognitive test was associated with greater gait-speed decline over 3 years: 0.016 m/s for the 3MS (SD = 8.1), 0.009 m/s for CLOX 1 (SD = 2.4), and 0.012 m/s for EXIT 15 (SD = 4.1) (p <.0005 for all). After adjustment for comorbidities, the effect size was attenuated for 3MS and CLOX 1, and the association for EXIT 15 was no longer significant. Depression score was most strongly associated with the EXIT 15 effect reduction., CONCLUSION: Global and executive cognitive functions predict declines in gait speed. The association of ECF with gait speed decline is attenuated by comorbid conditions, particularly depression. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying these associations may point to new pathways for the treatment of physical decline associated with diminished cognitive function.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of schizophrenia varies by individual-level characteristics and neighbourhood-level attributes. Few specific socio-environmental risk factors (SERFs) have been identified at the neighbourhood level. Cross-level interactions are poorly understood. We investigated these issues using data from the Aetiology and Ethnicity in Schizophrenia and Other Psychoses (AESOP) study., METHOD: All incidence cases of ICD-10 schizophrenia (F20) and other non-affective psychoses (F21-29), aged 16-64 years, across 33 wards in Southeast London were identified over a 2-year period (1997-1999). Census data provided the denominator for each ward. Multilevel Poisson regression simultaneously modelled individual- and neighbourhood-level SERFs, including socio-economic deprivation, voter turnout (proxy for social capital), ethnic fragmentation (segregation) and ethnic density., RESULTS: A total of 218 subjects were identified during 565 576 person-years at risk. Twenty-three per cent of variance in incidence of schizophrenia across wards could be attributed to neighbourhood-level risk factors [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.9-42.2]. Thus, 1% increases in voter turnout [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.99] and ethnic segregation (IRR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.99) were both independently associated with a reduced incidence of 5%, independent of age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation and population density. This was similar for other non-affective psychoses. There was some evidence that ethnic minority individuals were at greater risk of schizophrenia in areas with smaller proportions of minority groups (p=0.07)., CONCLUSION: SERFs at individual and neighbourhood levels were implicated in the aetiology of psychosis, but we were unable to determine whether these associations were causal. Individual risk may be mediated by social capital, which could operate as a protective factor, perhaps moderating social stress in the onset of psychoses.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing belief that the places where people live influence their health, there is surprisingly little consistent evidence for their associations with mental health. We investigated the joint effect of community and individual-level socio-economic deprivation and social cohesion on individual mental health status., METHODS: Multilevel analysis of population survey data on 10,653 adults aged 18-74 years nested within the 325 census enumeration districts in Caerphilly county borough, Wales, UK. The outcome measure was the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5) subscale of the SF-36 instrument. A social cohesion subscale was derived from a factor analysis of responses to the Neighbourhood Cohesion scale and was modelled at individual and area level. Area income deprivation was measured by the percentage of low income households., RESULTS: Poor mental health was significantly associated with area-level income deprivation and low social cohesion after adjusting for individual risk factors. High social cohesion significantly modified the association between income deprivation and mental health: the difference between the predicted mean area mental health scores at the 10th and 90th centiles of the low income distribution was 3.7 in the low cohesion group and 0.9 in the high cohesion group (difference of the difference in means = 2.8, 95% CI: 0.2, 5.4)., CONCLUSIONS: Income deprivation and social cohesion measured at community level are potentially important joint determinants of mental health. Further research on the impact of the social environment on mental health should investigate causal pathways in a longitudinal study.

T1  - Geographic variation in alcohol, drug, and mental health services utilization: what are the sources of the variation?.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Studies have documented geographic variation in health services utilization over a range of medical, surgical, and psychiatric conditions. These geographic differences are of concern to policy makers, as they may represent either excessive levels of unnecessary care or inappropriately low utilization of necessary services. However, the sources of geographic variation are not well understood, and variation may not represent a quality problem, to the extent that geographic variation is due to sampling variability or variation in case-mix across sites., AIMS OF THE STUDY: Our aim was to determine the extent to which geographic variation in assessment and treatment rates for alcohol, drug, and mental disorders (ADM) was due to variation in case-mix across sites and to quantify the amount of geographic variation after case-mix adjustment., METHODS: We analyzed data from Healthcare for Communities, a nationally representative telephone survey of ADM disorders and treatment. We utilized fixed effects and random intercept models to analyze whether individuals received a brief primary care ADM assessment, any primary care ADM treatment, any specialty ADM treatment, or any ADM treatment. Using the coefficient of variation and intra-class correlation (ICC) as summaries, we simulated reference distributions for the amount of variability in ADM assessment and treatment rates expected due to variation in case mix across 60 geographic areas. We compared this with the actual variation among our 60 sites, and the variation that remained after adjusting for ADM disorders, physical health, and socioeconomic characteristics., RESULTS: The amount of the variation in assessment and treatment rates explained by geographic area in unadjusted fixed effects and random intercepts models was statistically significant with R2 statistics ranging from 1% to 2% in fixed effects models and ICC's ranging from 0.009 to 0.043. Considerably more variation was explained in analyses that included individual level characteristics such as ADM disorders, physical health, and socioeconomic status, with R2 statistics from 10% to 19%. In random intercept models the ICC's were decreased 20 to 100% in models that adjusted for ADM disorders, physical health, and socioeconomic status., DISCUSSION: We found significant variation in ADM assessment and treatment rates across geographic sites. However, the magnitude of geographic variation was relatively modest, with 0.9 to 4.3% of the total variation in ADM assessment and treatment occurring at the geographic level. Further, it appears that a moderate amount of this geographic variation may be due to differences in case mix across sites., IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICY: Although geographic variation in assessment and treatment rates can signal variable quality, there may be only modest potential for improving quality by reducing geographic variation. Further, the success of efforts to decrease geographic variation by focusing on provider behavior may be limited by the extent to which systematic variation is explained by individual characteristics., IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: Future work on geographic differences in mental health care as well as in health services more generally should pay particular attention to adjusting for individual differences in morbidity, which strongly predict treatment utilization.

N2  - UNLABELLED: This study simultaneously tests the effect of county, organizational, workplace, and individual level variables on depressive disorders among low-income nursing assistants employed in US nursing homes. A total of 482 observations are used from two waves of survey data collection, with an average two-year interval between initial and follow-up surveys. The overall response rate was 62 percent. The hierarchically structured data was analyzed using multilevel modeling to account for cross-classifications across levels of data. Nursing assistants working in nursing homes covered by a single union in three states were asked about aspects of their working conditions, job stress, physical and mental health status, individual and family health-care needs, household economics and household strain., PARTICIPANTS: The 241 nursing assistants who participated in this study were employed in 34 nursing homes and lived in 49 counties of West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky., MAIN RESULTS: The study finds that emotional strain, related to providing direct care to elderly and disabled clients, is associated with depressive disorder, as is nursing home ownership type (for-profit versus not-for-profit). However, when controlling for county level socioeconomic variables (Gini index and proportion of African Americans living in the county), neither workplace nor organizational level variables were found to be statistically significant associated with depressive disorder., CONCLUSIONS: This study supports previous findings that emotional demand in health-care environments is an important correlate of mental health. It also adds empirical evidence to support a link between financial strain and depression in US women. While this study does not find that lack of a seniority wage benefits--a factor that can conceivably exacerbate financial strain over time--is associated with depressive disorder among low-income health-care workers, it does find county level measures of poverty to be statistically significant predictors of depressive disorder. Longitudinal county level measures of low-income as predictors of depression may even offer a methodological advantage in that they are presumably more stable indicators of cumulative exposure of low income than are more transient workplace indicators. Incorporating measures of cumulative exposure to low income into empirical studies would be particularly timely given the global changes that are currently restructuring the labor force and influencing work organization and labor processes--most notably the growth in low income jobs and the deskilling of labor. Though this study provides evidence that workplace and organizational level variables are associated with depressive disorder among low-wage nursing assistants in US nursing homes, the fact that these relationships do not hold once county level measures of poverty are controlled for, suggests that more distal upstream determinants of workplace mental health problems, such economic inequality, may be at play in determining the mental health of low wage workers.

N2  - We report on comparative analyses of small area variation in rates of acute hospital admissions for psychiatric conditions in Greater London around the year 1998 and in New York City (NYC) in 2000. Based on a theoretical model of the factors likely to influence psychiatric admission rates, and using data from the most recent population censuses and other sources, we examine the association with area indicators designed to measure access to hospital beds, socio-economic deprivation, social fragmentation and ethnic/racial composition. We report results on admissions for men and women aged 15-64 for all psychiatric conditions (excluding self-harm), drug-related substance abuse/addiction, schizophrenia and affective disorders. The units of analysis in NYC were 165 five-digit Zip Code Areas and, in London, 760 electoral wards as defined in 1998. The analysis controls for age and sex composition and, as a proxy for access to care, spatial proximity to hospitals with psychiatric beds. Poisson regression modeling incorporating random effects was used to control for both overdispersion in the counts of admissions and for the effects of spatial autocorrelation. The results for NYC and London showed that local admission rates for all types of condition were positively and significantly associated with deprivation and the association is independent of demographic composition or 'access' to beds. In NYC, social fragmentation showed a significant association with admissions due to affective disorders and schizophrenia, and for drug dependency among females. Racial minority concentration was significantly and positively associated with admissions for schizophrenia. In London, social fragmentation was associated positively with admissions for men and women due to schizophrenia and affective disorders. The variable measuring racial/ethnic minority concentration for London wards showed a negative association with admission rates for drug dependency and for affective disorders. We discuss the interpretation of these results and the issues they raise in terms of the potential and limitations of international comparison.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the study were to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for (11)C-flumazenil at tracer concentrations, to assess the effects of patient-related covariates and to derive an optimal sampling protocol for clinical use., METHODS: A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM) with data obtained from 51 patients with either depression or epilepsy. Each patient received approximately 370 MBq (1-4 microg) of (11)C-flumazenil. The effects of selected covariates (gender, weight, type of disease and age) were investigated. The model was validated using a bootstrap method. Finally, an optimal sampling design was established., RESULTS: The population pharmacokinetics of tracer quantities of (11)C-flumazenil were best described by a two compartment model. Type of disease and weight were identified as significant covariates (P < 0.002). Mean population pharmacokinetic parameters (percent coefficient of variation) were: CL 1530 mL min(-1) (6.6%), V(1) 24.8 x 10(3) mL (3.8%), V(2) 27.3 x 10(3) mL (5.4%), and Q 2510 mL min(-1) (6.5%). CL was 20% lower in patients with epilepsy, and the influence of weight on V(1) was 0.55% kg(-1). For the prediction of the AUC, a combination of two time points at t = 30 and 60 min post injection was considered optimal (bias -0.7% (95% CI -2.2 to 0.8%), precision 5.7% (95% CI 4.5-6.9%)). The optimal sampling strategy was cross-validated (observed AUC = 296 MBql(-1) min(-1) (95% CI 102-490), predicted AUC = 288 MBql(-1) min(-1) (95% CI 70-506))., CONCLUSIONS: The population pharmacokinetics of tracer quantities of (11)C-flumazenil are well described by a two-compartment model. Inclusion of weight and type of disease as covariates significantly improved the model. Furthermore, an optimal sampling procedure may increase the feasibility and applicability of (11)C-flumazenil PET.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Acromegaly is a serious hormonal disorder resulting from a pituitary adenoma causing excess growth hormone (GH) production. Somatostatin analogs such as octreotide have been the medical treatment of choice. SOM230, a novel somatostatin analog, was compared with octreotide with respect to pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles and inhibition of GH secretion in acromegalic patients., METHODS: In a double-blind, 3-period, crossover, proof-of-concept study, 12 patients with active acromegaly were randomized to single subcutaneous doses of SOM230 (100 and 250 microg) and octreotide (100 microg). Concentrations of SOM230, octreotide, and GH were determined at designated times after dosing and at baseline. The PK properties of SOM230 and octreotide and the relationship of PK with GH were investigated by a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling analysis., RESULTS: The apparent clearance for SOM230 is approximately half of that for octreotide (8.0 L/h versus 15.8 L/h). The elimination half-life for SOM230 is about 5 times longer than that for octreotide (11.8 hours versus 2.3 hours). The relationship between GH levels and plasma concentrations of SOM230 and octreotide is well described by a direct inhibitory model. The test drug concentration level at which half of the maximum drug effect is observed (EC50) is 46 and 553 pg/mL for octreotide and SOM230, respectively, with large interpatient variability (coefficients of variation, 164% and 65%, respectively), mainly attributable to the heterogeneous responses among patients., CONCLUSIONS: SOM230 demonstrates a lower clearance and longer half-life than octreotide, which compensates for the lower potency in GH inhibition. As a result of the lower interpatient variability for EC50 , SOM230 is expected to have a more uniform clinical GH inhibition than octreotide for acromegalic patients at a clinically effective dosing regimen.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Despite the ubiquitous use of propofol for anesthesia and conscious sedation and numerous publications about its effect, a pharmacodynamic model for propofol-induced ventilatory depression in the non-steady state has not been described. To investigate propofol-induced ventilatory depression in the clinically important range (at and below the metabolic hyperbola while carbon dioxide is accumulating because of drug-induced ventilatory depression), the authors applied indirect effect modeling to Paco2 data at a fraction of inspired carbon dioxide of 0 during and after administration of propofol., METHODS: Ten volunteers underwent determination of their carbon dioxide responsiveness by a rebreathing design. The parameters of a power function were fitted to the end-expiratory carbon dioxide and minute ventilation data. The volunteers then received propofol in a stepwise ascending pattern with use of a target-controlled infusion pump until significant ventilatory depression occurred (end-tidal pressure of carbon dioxide > 65 mmHg and/or imminent apnea). Thereafter, the concentration was reduced to 1 microg/ml. Propofol pharmacokinetics and the Paco2 were determined from frequent arterial blood samples. An indirect response model with Bayesian estimates of the pharmacokinetics and carbon dioxide responsiveness in the absence of drug was used to describe the Paco2 time course. Because propofol reduces oxygen requirements and carbon dioxide production, a correction factor for propofol-induced decreasing of carbon dioxide production was included., RESULTS: The following pharmacodynamic parameters were found to describe the time course of hypercapnia after administration of propofol (population mean and interindividual variability expressed as coefficients of variation): F (gain of the carbon dioxide response), 4.37 +/- 36.7%; ke0, CO2, 0.95 min-1 +/- 59.8%; baseline Paco2, 40.9 mmHg +/- 12.8%; baseline minute ventilation, 6.45 l/min +/- 36.3%; kel, CO2, 0.11 min-1 +/- 34.2%; C50,propofol, 1.33 microg/ml +/- 49.6%; gamma, 1.68 +/- 21.3%., CONCLUSION: Propofol at common clinical concentrations is a potent ventilatory depressant. An indirect response model accurately described the magnitude and time course of propofol-induced ventilatory depression. The indirect response model can be used to optimize propofol administration to reduce the risk of significant ventilatory depression.

T1  - County-level income inequality and depression among older Americans.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To examine (1) whether county-level income inequality is associated with depression among Americans aged 70 and older, taking into consideration county-level mean household income and individual-level socioeconomic status (SES), demographic characteristics, and physical health, and (2) whether income inequality effects are stronger among people with lower SES and physical health., DATA SOURCES: The individual-level data from the first wave of the Assets and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old survey (1993-1994) were linked with the county-level income inequality and mean household income data from the 1990 Census., STUDY DESIGN: Multilevel analysis was conducted to examine the association between income inequality (the Gini coefficient) and depression., PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Income inequality was significantly associated with depression among older Americans. Those living in counties with higher income inequality were more depressed, independent of their demographic characteristics, SES, and physical health. The association was stronger among those with more illnesses., CONCLUSIONS: While previous empirical research on income inequality and physical health is equivocal, evidence for income inequality effects on mental health seems to be strong.

N2  - Neighbourhood objective socio-economic indicators and community-reported subjective measures of social capital were examined in relation to children's health-related quality of life in the Netherlands. Three different data-sources were used: (1) objective neighbourhood socio-economic indicators, (2) subjective neighbourhood data on social capital, and (3) individual data of a family cohort study, including questions on children's health-related quality of life, and family socio-economic status. Multilevel analyses were conducted using both neighbourhood level and individual level data. Neighbourhood socio-economic status and social capital were associated. Measures of socio-economic deprivation and social capital were both non-specifically associated with children's general health and satisfaction, independent of possible individual-level confounders. However, children's mental health and behaviour were specifically associated with one aspect of social capital, the degree of informal social control in the neighbourhood.
