T1  - Participation in 12-Step Programs and Drug Use Among Older Adults With Cannabis Use Disorder: Six-Month Outcomes
AN  - 2472030405
AB  - This study examined associations among cannabis use disorder (CUD), 12-step program participation, and cannabis and other drug use at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Participants were age 50 or older in a study of veterans receiving medical management of alcohol and/or opioid withdrawal (N = 171). Generalized estimating equations examined the extent to which time point, 12-step program participation, and CUD were associated with change in number of cannabis and non-cannabis drug use days. Also examined was whether having CUD was associated with 12-step program participation. From baseline through the 6-month follow-up, 12-step program participation increased, non-cannabis drug use decreased, and cannabis use remained stable. Twelve-step program participation at baseline was associated with better outcomes at follow-ups. Participants with CUD reported less 12-step program participation and more cannabis use days at follow-ups. Older adults with CUD may need other types of psychosocial treatments due to low participation in 12-step programs.

T1  - Unemployment, sanctions and mental health: the relationship between benefit sanctions and antidepressant prescribing
AN  - 2471634516
AB  - International social security systems increasingly place work-related conditions on individuals claiming out-of-work benefits, and enforce requirements through the use of benefit sanctions. The literature on the impacts of benefit sanctions considers both labour market and wider social effects, which this study contributes to through a focus on mental health. It considers the period of Coalition government (2010–15) in the UK, which imposed a comparatively high number of benefit sanctions and increased their severity through the Welfare Reform Act 2012. A longitudinal dataset is constructed using quarterly local authority-level data on Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) sanctions and antidepressant prescriptions in England. Results from fixed effects analyses indicate that, in the post-reform period, every 10 additional sanctions are associated with 4.57 additional antidepressant prescribing items (95% CI: 2.14 to 6.99), which translates to approximately one additional person receiving treatment. Importantly, this finding indicates that sanctions are associated with both adverse mental health impacts and wider public expenditure implications, which motivates further investigation at the individual-level. In addition, punitive sanctions form a core part of the new Universal Credit (UC) and so the results suggest the need to reassess the use of sanctions within the contemporary social security system.

T1  - Decomposing the effects of childhood adversity on later-life depression among Europeans: a comparative analysis by gender
AN  - 2470170635
AB  - The aims of the present study are twofold: first, to examine the importance of socio-economic disadvantage, adverse experiences and poor health in childhood on later-life depression by sex and, second, to discern the direct and indirect effects of childhood circumstances using a decomposition technique. Data are derived from Waves 2 and 3 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The methods involve use of logistic regression models and a decomposition approach. The findings indicate that childhood socio-economic status (SES) for both genders and cognitive function for men have only a significant direct effect, consistent with the critical period model. Childhood health for men and poor parental mental health for women are nearly fully mediated by adulthood and later-life circumstances, a fact in line with the pathway model. Poor childhood health, parental excessive alcohol consumption and cognitive function for women and adverse experiences for men have both significant direct and indirect effects, consistent with both models. Mediating factors include poor adulthood and later-life health, socio-economic adversity and stress; adulthood and later-life SES mediate early life health and adverse experiences more strongly for men, whereas stress seems to mediate early life adverse experiences to a greater extent among women. Intervening policies should address childhood adversity while considering the differential vulnerability of men and women.

T1  - Does Location Matter for Micro Shops Resilience? Evidence from Uganda
AN  - 2469983386
AB  - This article analyzes the relationship between location and resilience of micro shops in Uganda. We use a unique city-level data set and consider the longevity of business as a proxy for resilience. After controlling for a set of relevant variables, our findings suggest positive correlation between longevity and proximity to Kampala, the capital city and vibrant commercial center of Uganda. We also find that entrepreneurship-related factors and natural events are further significant elements. We stress the importance to strengthen the integration between core and lagging areas as opposed to the current territorial development pattern. This calls for development models where the creation of satellite hubs and commercial platforms may positively influence the resilience of micro business.

T1  - Crisis, Adjustment and Resilience in the Greek Labor Market: An Unemployment Decomposition Approach
AN  - 2469983380
AB  - The crisis in Greece led to one of the largest economic shocks in European history. Drawing on micro-data from the Greek Labour Force Survey, we utilize standard micro-econometric methods and non-linear decomposition techniques to measure the size of the shock exerted on the Greek regional and national labor markets and the compositional and price adjustments in response to this. We find elements of economic dynamism, with some sizeable price adjustments in the economy of the Greek capital, Athens; but overall our results show that compositional adjustments (in labor quality/characteristics) have been partial and limited, becoming stronger only in the more recent recovery. Our results suggest a significant metropolitan advantage with regard to economic resilience, coming predominantly from a more efficient functioning of the labor market in metropolitan areas vis-a-vis other regions. Our use of the decomposition techniques for the analysis of macro-level developments in the labor market offers a novel perspective to the application of the decomposition methodology.

T1  - Inequality and Employment Resilience: An Analysis of Spanish Municipalities during the Great Recession
AN  - 2469983368
AB  - In this paper we study an association almost neglected in the literature, that between income inequality and resilience. In particular, we explore the response of employment rates in the face of the crisis of 2008 and how income inequality levels may have affected this response. To do so, we construct two measures of employment resilience—resistance and recoverability—using data on total employment and self-employment for 995 Spanish municipalities during the Great Recession. Our results provide evidence of the threats that high levels of inequality pose for employment resilience, showing that average income is the most important mediating factor of this association.

T1  - A novel hedonic price modelling approach for estimating the impact of transportation infrastructure on property prices
AN  - 2469983241
AB  - Hedonic estimations of the effect of transport infrastructure on property prices vary widely. This high variability demonstrates a deficit in our understanding of these relationships, limits the utility of econometrics for the valuation of urban property markets, and limits the development and implementation of effective and fair market-based policy tools. Several avenues may lead to improved consistency: re-consideration of accessibility, inclusion of urban design characteristics, assessment of spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity, and consideration of geographic scale. This paper outlines the rationale and opportunities for inclusion of, and presents empirical tests for, these assertions using a case study in western Sydney, Australia. Results show a number of urban design characteristics to be significant determinants of residential property price. Street connectivity and higher density in areas surrounding residences negatively impact price, higher density close to train stations positively impacted price in one model. Park-and-ride stations led to decreases in property values. Smaller study area results indicate a nonlinear relationship between distance to train station and property price and a disamenity impact for residences within 400 m of train stations. Relative accessibility measured as frequency of peak hour trains is a significant and positive determinant of price in the larger study area. Incorporation of a price trend surface and estimation using a spatial error model reduce the extent to which spatial autocorrelation overstates the effect of a train station on prices. These conceptual and empirical improvements further develop our understanding of the effect of transport infrastructure on property values.

Building on its history, heritage, and resources, the local economy changed towards the mining heritage tourism business. This article describes such a process of sustainable development and urban resilience through a two-stage approach. First, the focus is on explaining how the locality moved from being a mining industrial area to a mining heritage tourism place. In doing so, the study highlights the key role played by the cooperation of the local government and the nearby university. The second stage shows how the new economic model is firmly rooted on the mining identity of the place and what provides higher levels of sustainability to the destination from a social and cultural view. In this context, the article shows how the place identity model of tourism would be eager to limit the negative impacts usually associated with the spread of tourism, consequently receiving further support by the local population. To better understand the second-stage process, the study defines a theoretical framework and tests it empirically through a structural equation modeling approach. Results of the research provide regional policy advices.

T1  - The Illusion of Urbanization: Impact of Administrative Reform on Communities’ Resilience
AN  - 2469983202
AB  - While a large body of literature separately documents urban and rural resilience, little is known about how resilience evolves when communities experience an administrative reform that changes their judicial status from rural to urban. This paper explores the effects of the largest post-communist urbanization waves that took place in Romania in the early 2000s, when more communes were reclassified as towns. Using rich administrative data from 2000 to 2014, we employ a two-way fixed effect difference-in-differences research design to examine the impact of the reform on the resilience capacity of the affected communes. Our results reveal that the administrative reform had an initially positive impact on the physical resilience capacity. While the administrative reform did not have a significant effect on the overall resilience capacity of the newly declared towns, there are important differences across groups. The settlements situated in more developed counties and those with higher income levels were among the main beneficiaries. Negatively affected were mainly the poor communes and those that lack accessibility due to their mountain position and being far from big cities. In policy terms, this clearly emphasizes the need for place-sensitive policies complementing the administrative reform in order to help them escape from their rural uprootedness.

T1  - Getting by with a Little Help from Our Friends: The Role of Social Support in Addressing HIV-related Mental Health Disparities among Sexual Minorities in the Lower Rio Grande Valley
AN  - 2469980864
AB  - This study examines how social support and perceived discrimination influence depressive symptoms of sexual minorities (including, lesbian, gay, bisexual-identifying individuals, and others with same-sex sexual partners) relative to heterosexual peers, while considering the role of HIV-positive status. We surveyed low-income, predominantly Hispanic/Latino/as residents receiving STI-testing and/or HIV/AIDS care in the lower Rio Grande Valley of southernmost Texas. Respondents aged 18+ took a self-administered survey in English or Spanish in a clinic waiting room (N= 273). Based on OLS regression, HIV-positive status (OLS coefficient = 2.54, p< .01) and social support (OLS coefficient = −0.17, p< .001) were significant predictors of depressive symptoms among sexual minorities, but not those who identified as heterosexual. Perceived discrimination was uniquely associated with increased depressive symptoms among sexual minorities (interaction coefficient = 0.21, p< .05). Clinicians treating sexual minority patients for depression should consider developing and applying resources tailored to individuals’ level of social support and ongoing experiences of social discrimination.

T1  - One Less Reason Why: Viewing of Suicide-Themed Fictional Media is Associated with Lower Depressive Symptoms in Youth
AN  - 2469014245
AB  - Concerns about whether fictional media can have a contagion effect on youth viewers have been debated for several decades. In the 1980s these led to several lawsuits featuring heavy metal acts as defendants. More recently, concerns have been renewed following the popular television show 13 Reasons Why which depicts an adolescent girl’s suicide. The current study examines these concerns in a survey study of 174 youth and their caregivers. Results indicated that, contrary to concerns, viewing suicide themed fictional shows was associated with reduced depressive symptomology and was not associated with suicidal ideation specifically. Depression and suicidal ideation were most associated with experiencing with others’ suicides in real life, family environment, bullying and neurotic personality traits. The show 13 Reasons Why specifically was associated with either lower depression or suicidal ideation or null effects, depending on specific outcome. Although correlational, this evidence suggests that suicide prevention efforts should focus less on fictional media and more on prevention of bullying.

T1  - Exposing three dark sides of social innovation through critical perspectives on resilience
AN  - 2468556442
AB  - In this essay we expose three dark sides of social innovation (SI) by mobilising the concept of resilience. We examine implications for SI from (1) resilience thinking, (2) (critical) resilience studies and (3) the exceptional contexts in which resilience is needed. The first dark side of SI is that SIs lead to disruptions likely to cause unintended adverse consequences. The second dark side is that top-down SIs tend to be deployed in the name of vulnerable communities, but in neoliberal ways mainly concerned in making these communities more productive for society, at the risk of heightening their marginalisation. The third dark side is that SI discourse lends itself too easily to hijackings by powerful actors driving their own interests of capital accumulation while calling for communities to self-organise. We discuss how critical perspectives on resilience help us challenge these dark sides of SI.

T1  - Psychometric evaluation of a questionnaire for measuring factors related to mental health of women in an earthquake
AN  - 2468556015
AB  - The current study was performed with the aim of the psychometric evaluation of a questionnaire for measuring factors related to women’s mental health in an earthquake. This descriptive instrumental study was carried out on a population of 378 women with an earthquake experience in Kerman Province, Iran, in 2017–2018. The formal validity, content validity, criterion validity, factor analysis, and reliability of the questionnaire were measured using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. Moreover, descriptive statistics and Pearson’s correlation coefficient were used to report data. In the content validity stage, 34out of 85 items of the questionnaire were eliminated. In the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) stage, 2 items out of the remaining 51 items were removed due to weak factor loading and 49 items were defined in 6 factors. The convergent and divergent validities of the questionnaire were confirmed in relation to the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) (r = −0.23; P = .030) and World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF ‎(WHOQOL-BREF) (r = 0.32;P = .001). Using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, the reliability of the questionnaire‎was obtained to be 0.91. The reliability and validity of the study questionnaire were at an appropriate level, and thus, it can be used to perform extensive surveys among women who have ‎experienced earthquake.

T1  - Punitive welfare reform and claimant mental health: The impact of benefit sanctions on anxiety and depression
AN  - 2468555870
AB  - Internationally, policymakers assume that sanctioning claimants of unemployment benefits will engender both improved employment outcomes and wider positive effects. A growing evidence‐base challenges these expectations, though additional insight is needed from large‐scale longitudinal research. This article contributes by conducting a quantitative investigation into the mental health impacts of benefit sanctions. To do so, it focuses on a recent period in UK sanctions policy in which rates of sanctions varied markedly and their length was substantially increased. Using quarterly panel data for local authorities in England (Q3 2010–Q4 2014) and fixed effects models that control for important confounders, the analysis provides robust evidence that Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) sanctions lead to increases in self‐reported anxiety and depression. Evidence of this adverse impact is particularly clear following the increase in the length of sanctions in October 2012. The results have important implications for contemporary social security policy, which is underpinned by a similarly punitive sanctions regime. Whilst additional individual‐level research is needed to fully consider the causal relationships in operation, the findings support a precautionary approach that should seek to minimise the harm associated with sanctions. This implies taking steps to reduce both the severity and frequency of applied sanctions.

T1  - Anxious women or complacent men? Anxiety of statistics in a sample of UK sociology undergraduates
AN  - 2468554866
AB  - One of the most commonly identified obstacles in the learning-teaching of quantitative material is statistics anxiety. Of the factors analysed in relation to statistics anxiety, age and gender have received a substantial proportion of the research focus. Yet there is limited work that systematically examines the possibility of an interrelationship, or interaction, between age and gender and reported statistics anxiety. This article aims to directly address this gap in the research by examining this interaction. A secondary analysis of data gathered from across 34 institutions in the UK is undertaken. The research presented is the first to examine this issue using a multivariate-modelling framework in a UK context. Although the international literature tends to indicate that women disproportionately experience statistics anxiety, the findings here show women have a moderate likelihood of reporting anxiety. There is a group of unworried young men who are likely to require pedagogical attention. Indeed, it may be that the existence a group of complacent young men have women seem anxious by comparison.

T1  - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Earnings in Later-Life Self-Employment: ET&P
AN  - 2467805937
AB  - Recent studies have shown that individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are relatively often engaged in self-employment. We analyze whether self-employment mediates the relationship between ADHD and earnings. To overcome endogeneity concerns in the estimation of this relationship, we use the polygenic risk score (PRS) for ADHD. In our longitudinal sample of 7,905 individuals (50–65 years old) from the Health and Retirement Study, a standard deviation increase in the PRS for ADHD increases the odds of self-employment by 32% and decreases yearly earnings by 5%. Self-employment explains (mediates) 59% of the negative relationship between the PRS for ADHD and earnings.

T1  - Presidential Elections, Divided Politics, and Happiness in the USA
AN  - 2466672579
AB  - We examine the effects of the 2016 and 2012 US presidential election outcomes on subjective wellbeing across party identification. We use Gallup data and a regression discontinuity approach, and focus primarily on evaluative (life satisfaction) and hedonic (positive and negative affect) indicators. We find that both elections had strong negative wellbeing effects on those who identified with the losing party, with little or no increase in wellbeing for those identifying with the winning party. The negative effects for the losing side were larger in 2016 than in 2012, by a factor of three on some indicators, and were driven mainly by women and middle‐income households. As such, both elections had a net negative wellbeing effect, but more so in 2016. Local voting patterns did not have a substantial wellbeing impact, nor did congressional elections taking place the same day. In 2016, the election also changed respondents’ perceptions about the economy, their financial status, and their community. After both elections, hedonic wellbeing gaps across parties typically dissipated within two weeks, but there was more persistence in evaluative wellbeing gaps, especially in expected life satisfaction. The latter gap persisted throughout 2017.

T1  - Retirement, Pensions, and Depressive Symptoms Among Older Adults in China, England, Mexico, and the United States
AN  - 2466210410
AB  - This study explores the associations of retirement, and of public and private pensions, with older adults’ depressive symptoms by comparing differences between countries and age groups. Harmonized data were analyzed from the family of Health and Retirement Study in 2012–2013 from China, England, Mexico, and the United States (n = 97,978). Respondents were asked if they were retired and received public or private pensions. Depressive symptom was measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Retirement was significantly associated with higher depressive symptoms for the United States and with lower depressive symptoms for Mexico and England. Public pension was significantly associated with lower depressive symptoms for Mexico and with higher depressive symptoms for the United States and China. Private pension was significantly associated with lower depressive symptoms for the United States, China, and England. Our study shows that continuity theory demonstrates cross-national variation in explaining the association between retirement and depressive symptoms.

T1  - Association between Discrimination and Depressive Symptoms Among 2,162 Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Adults in South Korea: Does Community Connectedness Modify the Association?
AN  - 2466210024
AB  - This study investigated the association between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms among Korean lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals and explored the role of community connectedness in that association. We analyzed a nationwide cross-sectional survey of 2,162 LGB adults in Korea. Discrimination based on its types, including sexual orientation, over the past 12 months was classified into four categories: (1) ‘never experienced discrimination,’ experienced (2) ‘only sexual orientation discrimination,’ (3) ‘any of the other types of discrimination,’ and (4) ‘both sexual orientation discrimination and any of the other types of discrimination.’ Our findings suggest that there was a statistically significant association between ‘only sexual orientation discrimination’ and depressive symptoms among LGB individuals with a low-level of community connectedness, but not among those with a high-level. In the other two categories of discrimination, which included the other types of discrimination, the associations were statistically significant, regardless of the level of community connectedness.

T1  - Threshold Levels for Disorder, Inequity in Household Labor, and Frustration with the Partner among Emerging Adult Couples: A Dyadic Examination
AN  - 2465705907
AB  - Young adults increasingly express a desire to create egalitarian romantic partnerships, yet numerous studies have shown that women generally continue to assume the lion’s share of housework. Building on previous work on threshold levels of tolerance for dirt and disorder, on housework allocation, and on perceived fairness, the current longitudinal study documented the pathway by which threshold levels for housework lead to feelings of frustration with the partner over a period of six months. Data from 176 cohabiting emerging adult couples were analyzed using path analysis. Results confirmed the proposed model of feelings of frustration with the partner. More precisely, romantic partners’ threshold levels were associated with their and their partners’ feelings of frustration through the division of housework and perceptions of fairness. Gender differences, empirical and practical implications, and future research directions are further discussed.

T1  - Parental stress and resilience in autism spectrum disorder and Down syndrome
AN  - 2465704651
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare parental stress and resilience in parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Down syndrome (DS), and typical development (TD), and analyze the relationship between these two constructs. A total of 97 parents participated (ASD: n = 32, DS: n = 23, and TD: n = 42). The instruments used were the Parental Stress Index and the Resilience Scale. The ASD group obtained higher parental stress related to the child’s characteristics but not related to the parents’ characteristics. The three groups obtained moderate resilience, and high resilience was associated with low parental stress in the ASD and DS groups. The higher parental stress obtained in the ASD group, compared to the DS group, was not associated with aspects related to the parents or demographic and social factors of the families but rather with aspects related to the child and the characteristics of each disorder, as perceived by the parents.

T1  - Happy at a price: employment challenges, life satisfaction, and lifestyle benefits among older individuals in rural communities in Canada and Ireland
AN  - 2463951637
AB  - In this paper, we analyze individuals in rural communities within Ireland and two regions in Canada (Newfoundland and Ontario) to explore the relationship between employment, lifestyles and life satisfaction. A total of 106 participants were interviewed, with the vast majority being over forty years of age. We explore their employment experiences, and address two questions: how strongly is life satisfaction related to employment among older, rural adults?, and are there gender differences with respect to rural employment and life satisfaction? Relatively few of the participants we interviewed within these communities held permanent, full-time employment locally. Many of the ones holding (only) seasonal/casual employment or self-employment indicated that it was difficult to make a living, but were determined to stay and ‘make a go of it’. While the participants tended to tolerate, rather than be fully satisfied with, their employment conditions, the vast majority were satisfied or very satisfied with life, and many pointedly described the benefits of living in their chosen community. This held for women and men, and for those near 40 years of age (and among the few in this study who were younger), to those of retirement age. Typically, they were happy, but at a price.

T1  - Ways to Greater Happiness: A Delphi Study
AN  - 2471921208
AB  - In the first round of this Delphi study 14 experts suggested strategies for improving life-satisfaction. In a second round, experts rated these strategies for (a) effectiveness, (b) feasibility and (c) cost-effectiveness. They considered 56 strategies policy makers can use to raise average happiness in a nation and 68 ways in which individuals can raise their own happiness. Experts were informed about the average ratings made by the panel and about the arguments advanced. Then, in a third round, experts made their final judgments. Summed ratings for average effectiveness and feasibility of the strategies ranged between 8.4 and 4.9 on scale 2–10, which means that most of the recommendations were deemed suitable. Agreement was slightly higher on policy strategies than on individual ways to greater happiness. Policy strategies deemed the most effective and feasible are: (1) investing in happiness research, (2) support of vulnerable people and (3) improving the social climate, in particular by promoting voluntary work and supporting non-profits. Individual strategies deemed most effective are: (a) investing in social networks, (b) doing meaningful things and (c) caring for one’s health.

T1  - Cultural Evolution Shifts the Source of Happiness from Religion to Subjective Freedom
AN  - 2471921101
AB  - Numerous studies have reported a positive individual-level association between happiness and two psychologically distinct states of mind: religious faith and subjective freedom (a feeling of life control). Although the strength of these relationships varies across countries, no general pattern driving this variation has been shown so far. After surveying 40,534 randomly selected respondents from 43 nations, we find that in countries where happiness is more closely related to religious faith, it is less strongly associated with subjective freedom, and vice versa. We have also identified the driving force behind this inverse relationship. Rising individualism and emancipative values, as an outcome of modernization, diminish the importance of religious faith for people’s happiness, while increasing the importance of subjective freedom. We conclude that the dominant emancipatory direction of cultural evolution favors freedom over religion.

T1  - Meaning in Life Predicts Decreased Depressive Symptoms and Increased Positive Affect over Time but Does not Buffer Stress Effects in a National Sample of African-Americans
AN  - 2471921052
AB  - Few studies have specifically focused on meaning in life in African Americans and many important questions remain, including whether effects of meaning in life are direct or moderated by levels of stress. In a national sample of 909 African Americans, we tested meaning in life as a prospective predictor of changes in depressive symptoms and positive affect over a 2.5-year period. Controlling for demographics and hassles, meaning in life predicted decreased depressive symptoms and increased positive affect across the span of 2.5 years. Moderation effects were not found for hassles, age, or income. Gender moderated the effect of meaning on positive affect such that effects were stronger for women than for men. These results suggest that, for African Americans, meaning in life appears to robustly protect against future depressive symptoms and promote positive affect over time unaffected by amount of stress experienced or most demographic factors.

T1  - So Dissatisfied to Leave? The Role of Perceptions, Expectations and Beliefs on Youths’ Intention to Migrate: Evidence from a Developing Country
AN  - 2471920932
AB  - This study analyzes the extent to which Uruguayan youth’s economic dissatisfaction drives intention to migrate by exploring those factors that can affect people’s economic satisfaction. Causality is explored using instrumental variable analysis and conditional mixed process estimations. The findings of this study point to a causal negative relationship from economic satisfaction to youth’s desire to migrate in which economic satisfaction is instrumented through the ratio of an individual’s personal income relative to the average income of a certain reference group; specifically—individuals with the same education level. Also, results highlight the importance of individuals’ perceptions of the opportunities available in the country regarding social mobility, job access, housing and adequate income, in shaping youth’s reported economic satisfaction and therefore their desire to migrate.

T1  - The Body–Mind–Spirit Dimensions of Wellness Mediate Dispositional Gratitude and Life Satisfaction
AN  - 2471920889
AB  - This study analyzed the mediating effect of the body–mind–spirit dimensions of wellness between dispositional gratitude and life satisfaction among bachelor’s students enrolled at a midsized private university in Islamabad. Rooted in the Broaden-and-Build theory, the study explains how the positive emotion of gratitude may develop personal resources in terms of wellness behaviors or resources, which subsequently foster life satisfaction. The study sample of 779 students was divided into subsample 1 (n = 389) and subsample 2 (n = 390) through a randomizer to obtain solid results. As predicted, the results from a parallel mediation analysis using Model 4 of the PROCESS macro indicated that the body, mind, and spirit dimensions of wellness mediated the dispositional gratitude → life satisfaction link in the two subsamples. The implications of the results for interventions and future research are discussed.

T1  - A Latent Class Analysis of Adolescents in First-Year University: Associations with Psychosocial Adjustment Throughout the Emerging Adult Period and Post-University Outcomes
AN  - 2471693212
AB  - The long-term outcomes for adolescents who struggle in first-year university remain unexplored. This 7-year longitudinal study aimed to identify distinct groups of adolescents based on their characteristics/behaviors in first-year university, and then assess whether these groups differ in psychosocial adjustment trajectories (i.e., mental health, positive relationships) throughout the emerging adult period, as well as in graduation rates, employment characteristics, and reflections on time spent at university. Participants (N = 1017; 71% female; Year 1 Mage = 19 years) enrolled in a Canadian university completed a survey annually for 7 years. Four groups in Year 1 were identified: Good Students who exhibited no difficulties; Sensation-Seeking who prioritized social engagement and substance use over academic engagement but reported no psychological adjustment difficulties; Struggling Students who had the most difficulties; and Club Involved who exhibited high club involvement. The Struggling Students Group continued to have more psychosocial adjustment difficulties than the other groups during and after university, were more likely to drop out of university, and to later have less job satisfaction. This group requires the most support. Consideration also should be given to the Sensation-Seeking Group, as they reported a lack of academic motivation (and regret about that later) and also were more likely to drop out of university. At the same time, they may be more difficult to target given that they did not report psychosocial difficulties. Overall, the findings highlight the need for early support and discourage a ‘one-size fits all’ method for promoting psychosocial adjustment.

T1  - Depression Illness Representations Among Arabs in Israel: a Qualitative Study Comparing Younger and Older Adults
AN  - 2471647637
AB  - There has been a noticeable increase in the number of studies assessing perceptions regarding depression (illness representations) among people diagnosed with the disorder. However, these studies have examined mainly younger adults (ages 18 to 65), and very little is known about older adults. This study examined illness representations among younger and older Israeli Arabs with depression based on the Self-Regulation Model (SRM). A total of 12 Israeli Arabs (six younger adults aged 18–64 and six older adults aged 65+) diagnosed with depression took part in semi-structured, in-depth interviews. The majority of the participants in the younger group were female and married, compared to the older group which has a gender equal ratio, half of which are married. The data were analyzed thematically, guided by the SRM illness representations’ dimensions (identity; timeline; cause; consequences; control/cure; cyclical and coherence; and emotional representations). Differences between younger and older adults were found in some of the illness representations. Older adults described depression as a chronic illness associated with somatic symptoms, and did not believe in psychological treatment. Younger adults did not perceive depression as chronic, reported cognitive and emotional symptoms, and believed in the efficacy of psychological treatment. Our findings indicated that participants’ perceptions about depression appeared to be associated with their age, along with their unique cultural background as they are traditional but undergoing processes of modernization. This study stress the importance of illness representations in intervention programs tailored for different age groups, and considering their specific cultural needs.

T1  - Exploring the Perceptions of the Ageing Experience in Singaporean Older Adults: a Qualitative Study
AN  - 2471638560
AB  - Understanding older adults perceptions of health and adaptation processes to ageing can allow for more culturally aligned services and better targeted care. The aim of this exploratory qualitative study was to examine older adults perceptions of physical, psychological and social health and further understand the processes of adaptation and self-management of these health perceptions. Semi-structured in depth interviews (IDI) were conducted with ethnically diverse older adults in Singapore, aged 60 and above. Participants were asked open ended questions about their physical health, psychological health and their current social health and relationships. They were also asked methods of adaptation to these age related changes. In total, forty participants were interviewed. A thematic analysis identified five main themes when exploring perceptions of physical, psychological and social health. These included; 1) Slowing down 2) Relationship harmony 3) Financial harmony 4) Social connectedness and 5) Eating together. Adaptation and self-management of these health perceptions included six additional themes; 1) Keep moving 2) Keep learning; where continued self-determination and resilience was a key method in adapting to negative thoughts about declining physical health 3) Adopting avoidant coping behaviours 4) ‘It feels good to do good’; where finding meaning in life was to help others 5) ‘Power of Prayer’; which highlighted how older adults relegated responsibilities to a higher spiritual power 6) Social participation; which included engaging in community and religious social activities that all contributed to self-management of older adults psychological health and social health. In conclusion, our study highlighted specific cultural nuances in older adults perceptions of health, particularly psychological and social health. These findings can help develop more targeted intervention programmes and better methods of measuring older adults health, which can assist with the global ageing phenomena.

T1  - The Immigrant Paradox Among the UK’s Adolescents: Data from the LSYPE 2004–2010 Project
AN  - 2471587396
AB  - The literature on the acculturation of the UK’s ethnic minority youth by generation status is limited. This gap in knowledge base brings to question whether we see different adaption patterns among adolescents from different ethnic groups over time. I examined the sociocultural adaptation of the UK’s ethnic minority youth by comparing first-generation youth to their second plus generation counterparts. By doing so, I establish baseline measures of sociocultural adaptation for first-generation youth for this cohort. I compared 13–15-year-old adolescents on the sociocultural scales of risky behavior (7 items), feelings about school (11 items), mental health (12 items), relational family efficacy (4 items), and bully victimization (5 items), as well as on achievement gains by key stage 3 (9th grade). I used the first Longitudinal Study of Young People in England 2004–2010 database to make these analyses by modeling generation effects, ethnicity effects, and generation × ethnicity interaction effects (Bangladeshi, n = 743; Black African, n = 716; Black Caribbean, n = 990; Indian, n = 1019; Pakistani, n = 963; White immigrant, n = 232). Analyses included multivariate linear regression and hierarchical linear regression when appropriate. My findings demonstrated an immigrant paradox on achievement gains for four of the ethnic groups but an immigrant disadvantage on mental health for White immigrants. I discuss my findings within the contexts of segmented assimilation theory, protective factors, and supports that schools and communities can provide.

T1  - Determining a Positive Causal Relationship of Immigration on Living Standards
AN  - 2471587335
AB  - This project investigates the complex relationship between American citizens and America’s forty million plus immigrants by analyzing changes in the living standards of native-born Americans versus the immigrant population size. We aggregate data collected from the American Community Survey’s Public Use Microdata Samples from 2010 to 2015 at the Public Use Microdata Area level. Using the method of instrumental variables, we assess if and how immigrants affect the living standards of native-born Americans. With the number of ports of entry per state as the instrument, we find preliminary evidence to suggest a positive causal, not just correlational, relationship between percent of immigrants in an area and the average living standard of the area’s native-born citizens. As data availability improves, our methodology will allow for a stronger case to support a causal relationship between immigration and American living standards. It has the potential to provide data-driven policy recommendations that improve the economic opportunities of native-born citizens while also supporting immigration.

T1  - The risks connected with accidents on highways and railways
AN  - 2471568839
AB  - Safety in an integral sense is a comprehensive tool by which the humans ensure the level of their security and the sustainable development of them and of other basic public assets in a given territory. In addition to individual parts of human system it is necessary to consider their mutual links and flows being among them. One of the sectors in which security plays an important role is tourism. An integral part of it is transportation of persons, but also material and its associated safety. Safety is fundamental to any transport system; it must always be the top priority. The authors of this article focused on one particular specific area: the safety of transporting dangerous goods in the Czech Republic. The main reason was that traffic accidents with dangerous goods have big impacts on goods and vicinity, i.e. humans and environment (Maturo in Ecol Indic 90:305–315, 2018). They are accompanied by fire, explosion, leakage of dangerous substances, or combination of these phenomena. These facts have economic impacts on carriers (damage or destruction of goods) and as well as on protected assets at the accident site (damage to infrastructure, human health injury or loss of human lives of persons being in the vicinity, harms in environment). The aim of the paper is to analyse the traffic accidents involving dangerous substances on the motorways and main railway routes in the Czech Republic, to characterize their impacts, to judge response in case of accidents´ occurrences and on evaluation of real data to suggest the measures for increasing safety in the carriage of dangerous substances. The authors focused on the statistical evaluation of accidents and on analysis of accidents during the transport of dangerous substances from the perspective of the impacts on people and other public assets.

T1  - Tourism satisfaction and perspectives: an exploratory study in Italy
AN  - 2471567616
AB  - The aim of the paper is to analyze the specific features of tourism in Italy through tourists’ behaviour and satisfaction level and to individuate future perspectives. A representative sample was analyzed through factor and cluster analysis to interpret the factors that affect the touristic performance according to specific indicators, which affect tourists’ features and their tourism expectation. The findings show three segmented customer’s groups with different levels of desire, satisfaction and perceived happiness and identify also synergistically strategic actions to revitalize tourism in the considered region. The research is the first of this kind in the area and a base for further studies.

T1  - Life satisfaction, loneliness and togetherness, with an application to Covid-19 lock-downs
AN  - 2471560956
AB  - Using the 2012–2013 American Time Use Survey, I show that both “who” people spend time with and “how” they spend it affect their life satisfaction, adjusted for numerous demographic and economic variables. Life satisfaction among married individuals increases most with additional time spent with one’s spouse. Among singles, satisfaction decreases most as more time is spent alone. Additional time spent sleeping or TV-watching reduces satisfaction, while longer usual workweeks and higher incomes increase it. Nearly identical results are shown using the 2014–2015 British Time Use Survey. The US estimates are used to simulate the impacts of Covid-19 lock-downs on life satisfaction.

T1  - The Effect of Gender Role on Attitudes Towards Inequitable Gender Norms Among Malaysian Men
AN  - 2471558300
AB  - The Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) measure is the most frequently tested gender role instrument and one of the most investigated psychometric constructs in general. However, its application to the Malaysian setting as well as its relation to gender equality attitudes is rarely explored. Therefore, this research guided by the social constructionist perspective aims to examine the relationship between gender role (masculinity and femininity) and attitudes towards inequitable gender norms. A sample of 168 Malaysian men completed the two measures of Gender Equitable Men scale and the BSRI. Results showed that there was a significant relationship between gender role and attitudes towards inequitable gender norms. In contrast to the femininity gender role, masculinity gender role in men contributes to gender inequality attitudes. The findings in this study are largely supporting the theory that masculinity may be a key construct in the men’s negative attitudes about gender equality, which has been shown to be an important predictor of achieving women’s right and empowerment. In this article, we highlight the importance of socialization processes in context and consider how the social construction of gender affects attitudes about sexuality, reproductive health, gender roles and violence against women.

T1  - Pro-choice and Pro-life Are Not Enough: An Investigation of Abortion Attitudes as a Function of Abortion Prototypes
AN  - 2471558298
AB  - Attitudes toward abortion were investigated as being comprised of two dimensions: attitudes toward abortion as a procedure and attitudes toward choice. By separating the two dimensions as conceptually distinct, attitudinal groups expand beyond the traditional “pro-choice” and “pro-life” absolutist categories to include dilemma and regulated groups. Dilemma people are those who are negative toward abortion but positive toward choice. Regulated individuals are those who are not negative toward abortion but believe that abortion should be strictly controlled rather than an individual choice. People in these situationist positional groupings were hypothesized to hold different abortion attitudes and exhibit different individual difference profiles relative to those endorsing the absolutist perspectives regarding abortion. Using a sample of university student participants, the study results partially supported the existence of the dilemma and regulated attitudinal groups. As expected, those endorsing pro-choice and pro-life positions regarding abortion were different from each other on abortion attitudes as well as on a number of sexuality-related, gender-role attitude, and conservatism individual difference measures. Of note were the findings that the situationists (i.e., dilemma and regulated groups) tended to fall in between the two absolutist groups in relation to abortion attitudes and differed on the personality measures. It is insufficient to dichotomize attitudes toward abortion as either pro-life or pro-choice; this research suggests that, at minimum, there is a substantial intermediate group of situationists. By identifying and understanding this middle group, the issue of abortion may become less polarized and divisive. The situationists are a large proportion of attitude holders; this group may have a substantial impact on laws, regulations, human rights, and research surrounding abortion issues.

T1  - Condom Use by Female Sex Workers: A Nationwide Survey in Iran
AN  - 2471557960
AB  - Condom use has been known as the most effective method of preventing sexually transmitted diseases. The purpose of the present study was to find the factors affecting the use of condoms by female sex workers in Iran. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 872 female sex workers in Iran in 2010. The criterion of admission to the study included having sexual relationships over the last week based on which 437 women were selected. The weighted negative binomial hurdle model, and Stata14 were used to analyze the data. Generally, 34.93% of the female sex workers did not use condoms over the last 7 days. According to the results, the increase in the education level and not being single increased the odds and the rate number of using condoms concerning the number of sexual relationships of the sex workers. Besides, the increase in age and having a non-paying sexual partner in return for the sexual relationship decreased the odds of using condoms by female sex workers. Finally, the female sex workers who were tested for HIV and the ones knowing the centers distributing free condoms were more likely to use the condom. The illiterate and married female sex workers are considered as the high-risk groups in the community. Therefore, it is of great importance to plan to form the educational interventions connected with the high-risk sexual relationships.

T1  - Pathways to Child Sexual Offending: Applying Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model on Offenders Convicted of Penetrative Offenses on Children
AN  - 2471557831
AB  - Although research supports Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model to child sexual offending, few studies have empirically validated it. The current study aimed to explore the applicability of the Pathways Model on offenders convicted of penetrative offenses on children. All available sentencing remarks across a 10-year period in one jurisdiction of Australia were analyzed (58 offenders). A multi-methods approach was used. Regarding descriptives, most offenders were male, late thirties, single, employed, completed grade 10, had previous sexual convictions, an extrafamilial relationship with the victim, pleaded guilty, and received a custodial sentence. Most victims were female, with an average age of 11. While the deductive thematic analysis captured Ward and Siegert’s Pathways, sub-groups emerged within the emotional dysregulation pathway: impulsivity, sexualized coping, and mental health. These findings are valuable for researchers and practitioners, with implications for tailored treatment and prevention due to enhanced understanding on the motives for child sexual offending.

T1  - The Black Woman’s Math Problem: Exploring the Resilience of Black Women Who Lead in the United States Federal Government
AN  - 2471552466
AB  - This autoethnography explores a fictional character known as “Sarah” who represents the Black woman’s leadership experience in the U.S. federal government. Sarah is professional, loyal, and passionate in her pursuit of authentic leadership. Yet, she continues to struggle to find acceptance in her authentic identity and leadership style amongst her peers. Sarah has learned to create a balance of personal harmony and professional success and seeks to pass this wisdom on to the next generation. This paper contributes to the field of qualitative inquiry by providing poetic musings and insight into the work culture, race, and gender barriers that often impact Black women. Black women’s voices were silenced during slavery, and they continue to seek a platform from which they can speak, be heard, and be equally included in modern conversations. Sarah’s story seeks to provide voice, wisdom, and a unique forum to share four women’s leadership journeys, in a palatable manner, to all audiences.

T1  - Cheers to Equality! Both Hostile and Benevolent Sexism Predict Increases in College Women’s Alcohol Consumption
AN  - 2471530160
AB  - Based on research suggesting that alcohol consumption can be used as a means of coping with negative affect (Cooper et al. 1995), the current study examines sexism as a factor in college women’s alcohol consumption. Despite being more prevalent than hostile sexism, benevolent sexism is often viewed as less sexist (Oswald et al. 2018) and having a less aversive impact on women (Bosson et al. 2010). To increase understanding of the negative effects of both hostile and benevolent sexism, the current study experimentally manipulated sexism during a lab session and measured 176 U.S. college women’s actual alcohol consumption that evening. As predicted, college women who experienced either the hostile or the benevolent sexism condition reported consuming a greater number of alcoholic drinks, and those in the hostile sexism condition were more likely to meet the binge drinking threshold than participants in the control condition. This pattern suggests the importance of examining the unique effects of benevolent sexism in addition to hostile sexism because both may influence women’s behavior even in important health domains. Given the many negative consequences associated with alcohol consumption, our results provide evidence for education on healthy coping mechanisms and interventions to reduce both hostile and benevolent sexism.

T1  - Exploring police response and interaction with people with mental illness in Guyana
AN  - 2470251139
AB  - In many developing countries, police officers are called upon to intervene in matters related to people with mental illness (PMI) and therefore constitute an important facet of pathways to medical care. Globally, police officers come into frequent contact with PMI and they (police) play a central role in the management of these individuals, however, police-PMI contact pose complex challenges for most police officers. Instructively, mental health professionals contend that police officers are not best suited to handle PMI and that many PMI are incarcerated, seriously injured or die as a result of their contact with the police. This study explores police officers’ attitude, response and interaction with PMI in Guyana in order to assist with the development of appropriate interventions when policing PMI. The study utilises a random sample of police officers (N = 130) from the Guyana Police Force (GPF) to achieve the study’s objectives. A modified variant of the Mental Health Attitude Survey for Police (MHASP) was used to garner the views of the participants. The findings indicate: (1) that a considerable amount of police time was spent dealing with PMI each week, (2) that contact with PMI pose considerable difficulties for police officers, (3) that the most common police interactions with PMI were investigations, arrests and conveying PMI to hospitals, (4) that police training on responding to PMI is insufficient, and (5) that mental health training can improve officers’ ability to efficiently police PMI. Recommendations for training, directions for future research and policy implications are also discussed.

T1  - Culturally Relevant Resilience: A Psychometric Meta‐Analysis of the Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM)
AN  - 2470020230
AB  - Measuring key components of resilience is vital for understanding cross‐cultural dynamics among youth and the environment. The Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM‐28) was developed as a cross‐cultural measure of resilience and has been used globally. To examine the cross‐cultural utility of the CYRM‐28, we conducted a systematic review of the literature reporting on the psychometric properties of the measure. Using data representing six countries (N = 6,232) that were supplied from authors of the studies reviewed, a multilevel confirmatory factor analysis was also conducted to estimate the variability of the measurement properties among communities, ages, and sex. Results indicate that the literature generally did not include reliability and validity information for the instrument. From the multilevel confirmatory factor analysis, the measure was invariant between adolescent age‐groups and sexes but not across communities.

T1  - Daily Links Between Helping Behaviors and Emotional Well‐Being During Late Adolescence
AN  - 2470020133
AB  - We investigated daily associations between helping behaviors and emotional well‐being during late adolescence, examining whether these links depend on the recipient of help (i.e., friend vs. roommate), type of help (i.e., instrumental vs. emotional), and individual differences in the helper (i.e., gender and empathy). First‐year college students (N = 411, 63.5% women, Mage = 18.62 years) completed diary checklists for eight days, reporting whether they provided instrumental and emotional support to a friend or roommate, and positive and negative emotions. On days that adolescents provided instrumental assistance to friends they felt more positive affect, but men also felt more negative affect. Providing instrumental and emotional support to roommates and providing emotional support to friends did not predict daily emotions.

T1  - The Making of the Experimental Subject: Apparatus, Automatism, and the Anxiety of the Early Avant-Garde
AN  - 2469745196
AB  - This essay presents the experimental subject as a figure of modernity. It addresses notions of control, sensory thresholds, automatism, and human agency through a study of experimental psychology and psychological apparatus from the late 19th century to the First World War, juxtaposing this with notions of experimentation in early 20th-century avant-garde movements. The human subject of experimental psychology, defined by its inexpression as it awaits the stimuli of testing and measurement, is treated as a prototype for the present-day user of technological interfaces.

T1  - Social Estrangement and Psychological Distress before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Patterns of Change in Canadian Workers
AN  - 2468581706
AB  - This article argues that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing measures intended to slow the rate of transmission of the virus resulted in greater subjective isolation and community distrust, in turn adversely impacting psychological distress. To support this argument, we examine data from the Canadian Quality of Work and Economic Life Study, two national surveys of Canadian workers—one from late September 2019 (N = 2,477) and the second from mid-March 2020 (N = 2,446). Analyses show that subjective isolation and community distrust increased between the two surveys, which led to a substantial rise in psychological distress. Increases in subjective isolation were stronger in older respondents, resulting in a greater escalation in psychological distress. These findings support a Durkheimian perspective on the harm to social integration and mental health caused by periods of rapid social change but also illustrate how a life course context can differentiate individual vulnerability to disintegrative social forces.

T1  - The Long Arm of Social Integration: Gender, Adolescent Social Networks, and Adult Depressive Symptom Trajectories
AN  - 2468580859
AB  - Peer connections in adolescence shape mental health in ways that differ by gender. However, it is unclear whether this association has an enduring impact on life course mental health. Using growth models with survey data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health Waves I–IV, N = 13,821, 51% white, 49% male), we examine how two dimensions of social integration during adolescence—popularity and sociality—predict depressive symptom trajectories from adolescence to adulthood (ages 12–32) by gender. We find that for both men and women, low sociality predicts higher depressive levels through adolescence into adulthood. For women, higher popularity predicts greater depressive symptoms in adolescence, followed by a steeper decline to lower levels in early adulthood. Overall, this study suggests that social integration among peers in adolescence has long-term consequences for mental health that vary by gender.

T1  - Neighborhood Disorder and Distress in Real Time: Evidence from a Smartphone-Based Study of Older Adults
AN  - 2468580714
AB  - Socioeconomic disadvantage and disorder in the residential neighborhood have been linked to multiple health risks, but less is known about the relevance of other spaces of daily life. This article considers whether disadvantage and disorder in the immediate context—within or outside of the residential neighborhood—is associated with physiological symptoms indicative of stress and strain. We use data from a study of 61 older adults in four New York City neighborhoods. Participants carried smartphones to capture GPS locations and ecological momentary assessments during the study week. We find that instantaneous exposure to disorder is associated with momentary spikes in pain and fatigue. This is not explained by cumulative exposure to disorder or concurrent stress or fear. Rather, disordered spaces may be physically and cognitively taxing for older adults in real time. We urge further research on short- and long-term health consequences of activity spaces.

T1  - Group membership and radicalization: A cross-national investigation of collective self-esteem underlying extremism: GPIR
AN  - 2466739977
AB  - Uncertainty, perceived threats, and a generally insecure life attachment have been associated with endorsement of extremism. Furthermore, salient identification with a group can influence radicalized ways of addressing insecure life attachment through an established and sometimes extreme worldview and ideology. In the present study, we replicated the finding that an insecure life attachment is associated with a higher degree of extremism endorsement. Furthermore, we found similarities and differences in how this association was influenced by various aspects of group membership across dissimilar contexts and among majority and minority groups (e.g., Muslims and non-Muslims) from Denmark (n = 223), India (n = 147), and the United Kingdom (n = 225). Consequently, our results indicate that general social psychological processes underlie radicalization and that different aspects of collective self-esteem can be central promoting or mitigating factors. Overall, our findings suggest an important interplay among life attachment, collective self-esteem, and extremism across Western and non-Western majority and minority groups.

T1  - Isolation but Diffusion? A Structural Account of Depression Clustering among Adolescents
AN  - 2465994436
AB  - Depression can cause people to withdraw from friendships or be avoided by others, protecting others from exposure to that depression. Yet, researchers observe depression contagion, particularly among adolescents. We address this empirical puzzle by examining the role of gender in structuring friendship networks and the implications for isolation and the spreading of depression. Using stochastic actor-based models of friendships among 421 adolescents from mixed-gender, all-girls, and all-boys classrooms in six Taiwanese high schools, we find that networks with only girls are characterized by high reciprocity and low transitivity. This, in turn, facilitates the withdrawal of depressed girls from interactions. In contrast, networks with all boys create more opportunities for depression to spread through interconnected pathways. Our computational experiment further demonstrates that local preferences governing friendship choice influence levels of network connectivity. This, coupled with depression withdrawal and peer influence, shapes depression prevalence at the network level. These findings refine our understanding of the mechanisms through which friendships expose boys and girls unequally to health risks of depression.

T1  - Associations between parent-reported family economic hardship and mental health conditions in U.S. children
AN  - 2465703593
AB  - This study examines the association between parent-reported family economic hardship (FEH) and child mental health conditions. We hypothesized a positive association between parent perceptions of FEH and child mental health conditions that would persist after controlling for underlying demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Cross-sectional data came from the 2016 and 2017 National Surveys of Children's Health (NSCH), nationally representative surveys of non-institutionalized children in the United States, aged 0–17 years. We conducted chi-square as well as multivariable logistic regression analyses to investigate the relationships between FEH and internalizing disorders and behavioral/conduct problems among children ages 3–17 years. Overall, one in four children experienced FEH during their lifetime. FEH was statistically significantly (p < 0.0001) and positively correlated with each mental health condition, and the association remained after adjusting for covariates. Specifically, FEH was associated with 84% increased odds of having an internalizing disorder (OR = 1.84, 95%, CI: 1.54–2.20) and 53% increased odds of having behavioral/conduct problems (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.25–1.87). Findings suggest that income alone may be an insufficient predictor of the health risks of economic hardship. Further research should examine FEH as a broader measure of disadvantage and its relationship with child health.

T1  - Building connections and slaying basilisks: fostering support, resilience, and positive adjustment for sexual and gender minority youth in online fandom communities
AN  - 2465329785
AB  - Sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) disproportionately experience risks including discrimination and victimization, as well as psycho-social and behavioral concerns. There remains a relative lack of attention to factors promoting their positive development – particularly via online modalities. Research on their supportive use of technologies in specific contexts is necessary to explain the positive outcomes of contemporary SGMY despite their experiences of excessive risk. This article employs uses and gratifications theory to investigate online fandom communities as a source of social support for SGMY, as well as the potential of these online communities to contribute to their resilience and positive adjustment. A sample (n = 3665) of SGMY aged 14–29 ( = 17.77) was drawn from a mixed methods online survey. Results indicate participation in online fandom communities may increase connectedness, provide opportunities for support and mentorship, facilitate navigation of challenges towards positive adjustment, and encourage feelings of strength. Implications for research and professional practice are emphasized.

AB  - In their exhaustive introduction (pp. 1–13), Jessica Dijkman and Bas van Leeuwen outline the central issue, the theories and concepts, the different actors, and some general patterns that form the basis of this book, which they say discusses the “societal resilience to food crises and famines: the responses and strategies at the societal level that effectively helped individuals and groups to cope with drops in food supply, in various parts of the world over the past two millennia” (p. 1).

The author reconstructs how colonial and postcolonial governments coped with restricted access to food and volatile food prices in relation to the role played by the market and the local communities.

The author focuses on the four mass mortality famines that occurred in Ethiopia (1999–2000), Malawi (2001–2002), Niger (2005), and Somalia (2011) during the twenty-first century and on the predictable character of these food shortages, in relation to the historical context, and on the market, state, and civil society responses of each country analysed.

T1  - An Empirical History of the US Postal Savings System
AN  - 2454580482
AB  - Seeking to reach the unbanked, the US Postal Savings System provided a federally insured savings alternative to traditional banks. Using novel data sets on postal deposits, demographic characteristics, and banks, we study how and by whom the system was used. We find the program was initially used by nonfarming immigrant populations for short-term saving, then as a safe haven during the Great Depression, and finally as long-term investments for the wealthy during the 1940s. Postal Savings was only a partial substitute for traditional banks, as locations with banks often still heavily used Postal Savings.

T1  - Mental Health Impacts of Child Labour: Evidence from Vietnam and India
AN  - 2449827054
AB  - A number of recent studies have investigated the relationship between child labour and physical health. However, there has been little empirical evidence that child labour affects children’s emotional and behavioural development. This study departs from existing literature by examining the mental health impacts of child labour in Vietnam and India, as measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. The potential endogeneity of child labour is addressed by using rainfall as the instrument. The findings show that children engaged in child labour suffer from mental health issues as measured by peer problems and reduced prosocial behaviour in both countries. There is a significant gender difference in the impact of child labour in India. Finally, doing household chores, an accepted social and cultural work in developing countries is found to be associated with the better mental health of children in Vietnam.

T1  - Evaluating Program Impact on Resilience: Evidence from Lesotho’s Child Grants Programme
AN  - 2449826495
AB  - Social protection programmes can play a crucial role in enhancing household resilience. Although there is vast evidence on the impact of cash transfer projects on many welfare outcomes, no study examines the impact of cash transfers on a composite measure of resilience. This paper fills this important gap by employing a difference-in-difference estimator in the context of a randomised control trial in Lesotho to explore the causal effect of a Child Grant Programme on resilience capacity. Results show a positive and significant short-term impact, largely driven by the beneficial effects for less resilient households. The main transmission channels are increases in household expenditure and food security. Strong stimulus of the Programme on expenditure in education, a key resilience determinant, anticipates longer-run virtuous intergenerational dynamics in resilience building. The policy implication of this work is that social protection interventions should be embedded within the larger framework of resilience-enhancing programmes.

T1  - Responsibilization and Sexual Stigma Under Austerity: Surveying Public Support for Government-Funded PrEP in England
AN  - 2449451437
AB  - IntroductionUnder austerity, governments shift responsibilities for social welfare to individuals. Such responsibilization can be intertwined with pre-existing social stigmas, with sexually stigmatized individuals blamed more for health problems due to “irresponsible” sexual behavior. To understand how sexual stigma affects attitudes on government healthcare expenditures, we examine public support for government-provisioned PrEP in England at a time when media narratives cast the drug as an expensive benefit for a small, irresponsible social group and the National Health Service’s long-term sustainability was in doubt.MethodsThis paper uses data from an original survey (N = 738) conducted in September 2016, when public opinion should be most sensitive to sexual stigma. A survey experiment tests how the way beneficiaries of PrEP were described affected support for NHS provision of it. Contrary to expectations, we found that support was high (mean = 3.86 on a scale of 1 to 5) irrespective of language used or beneficiary group mentioned. Differences between conditions were negligible.DiscussionSexual stigma does not diminish support for government-funded PrEP, which may be due to reverence for the NHS; resistance to responsibilization generally; or just to HIV, with the public influenced by sympathy and counter-messaging.Social policy implicationsHaving misjudged public attitudes, it may be difficult for the government to continue to justify not funding PrEP; the political rationale for contracting out its provision is unnecessary and flawed. With public opinion resilient to responsibilization narratives and sexual stigma even under austerity, welfare retrenchment may be more difficult than social policymakers presume.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Opposition to Same-Sex Parents: the Mediation Effect of Satisfaction with Contact
AN  - 2449451148
AB  - IntroductionThe intergroup contact variable has been widely studied in the literature, and it has been shown to be closely related to less prejudice. The present article analyzes the role of an affective mediator in the relationship between the degree of contact-rejection of the outgroup (same-sex parents) variables, linked to the variable quality of contact or satisfaction with contact with people with a homosexual sexual orientation.MethodsThe sample is composed of 401 Spanish university students (67 males, 16.2%, and 347 females, 83.8%) with a mean age of 21 years (SD = 3.20). The data collection took place between November 2016 and March 2017.ResultsThe results show a complete mediation effect in the case of open or traditional prejudice (individual opposition), and partial mediation when analyzing modern or subtle rejection of same-sex parents (normative opposition).ConclusionsOur findings suggest that efforts to reduce the rejection of same-sex parents must take into account the individual’s positive evaluation of the contact because it is a mechanism that mediates the relationship between degree of contact and rejection.Social policy implicationsHomophobia intervention programs must consider the intergroup contact variable, taking into account that it is also necessary to act on positive emotions and affectivity toward relationships with people with a homosexual sexual orientation. Increasing positive contact with same-sex parents could be a key element in reducing rejection toward the effects of their child-rearing on their children.

T1  - Sexual Anxiety Among Women Living with HIV in the Era of Antiretroviral Treatment Suppressing HIV Transmission
AN  - 2449450870
AB  - IntroductionSustained undetectable viral loads (UDVLs) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) eliminate sexual HIV transmission. We measured prevalence and correlates of sexual anxiety among women living with HIV.MethodsWe used questionnaire data collected between August 2013 and May 2015 from 1422 women ≥ 16 years in the Canadian HIV Women’s Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study. Among women reporting consensual sex in the past month (n = 474), we determined the proportion who reported high anxiety (“always/usually became anxious or inhibited during sexual activity with a partner”), low anxiety (“sometimes/seldom”), and no anxiety. Logistic regression identified medical, psychological, relational, and social correlates, including awareness of ART prevention benefits (i.e., “makes the risk of transmitting HIV a lot lower”).ResultsCohort diversity is reflected in age (range 17–66; median 39), gender (5.7% trans), ethnicity (41.6% White, 24.5% Indigenous, 27.0% African/Caribbean/Black), sexual orientation (14.2% lesbian/queer), and time living with HIV (range 18 days–30 years.). Overall, 58.6% reported feeling no sexual anxiety, while the remainder said that they always/usually (14.6%) or sometimes/seldom (26.8%) became anxious or inhibited during sex. Current sex work, previous illicit drug use, and depression were associated with higher adjusted odds of sexual anxiety, while greater emotional closeness and more equitable relationship power were associated with lower odds. There was no correlation between awareness of ART prevention benefits and sexual anxiety.ConclusionsRelatively few women reported high anxiety during sex with a partner. This was more socially and relationally influenced than linked to understanding ART prevention benefits.Policy ImplicationsWomen living with HIV should be supported to have great sex, free from worry, by tackling unequal power in women’s intimate relationships, lack of access to resources, and mental health difficulties.

T1  - Objective and subjective markers of transition to adulthood in emerging adults: Their mediating role in explaining the link between parental trust and life satisfaction
AN  - 2449436102
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the direct and indirect (via objective and subjective markers of adulthood) relations of parental trust and emerging adults’ life satisfaction in samples of Lithuanian (N = 399, ages 18–25) and Japanese (N = 585, ages 18–25) emerging adults. Results revealed that parental trust was associated with emerging adults’ life satisfaction both directly and indirectly via subjective markers of adulthood (i.e., self-perception of oneself as an adult) but not via objective markers of adulthood. Importantly, these associations were largely similar in both countries with a slight variation. These findings underscore the complex and important relations between parental trust and life satisfaction during emerging adulthood.

T1  - Different effects of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance on depressive symptoms: A meta-analysis
AN  - 2449436097
AB  - Although insecure adult attachment is thought to be associated with depressive symptoms, results of research on the link between attachment dimensions (attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance) and depressive symptoms have been inconsistent. The aim of this study was to use meta-analysis to examine the strength of the correlations between the two attachment dimensions and depressive symptoms. A total of 64 papers and 78 independent samples were included in this meta-analysis. Results showed significant associations between both attachment dimensions and depressive symptoms. Additional analyses indicated that attachment anxiety was more strongly related to depressive symptoms, whereas attachment avoidance was weakly related to depressive symptoms. Cultural orientation and sex were found to moderate the relationship between attachment anxiety and depressive symptoms. Age was a significant moderator of the relationships between both attachment anxiety and avoidance and depressive symptoms. Results of the meta-analysis and the implications were discussed.

T1  - Romantic intimacy and terror management: Examining the mediating roles of felt security, relational self-esteem, and relational worldview defense
AN  - 2449435664
AB  - Terror management theory posits that close relationships assuage existential mortality concerns because they foster attachment-based felt security, enhance self-esteem, and validate shared cultural worldviews. However, the relative buffering influence of these mechanisms remains relatively unknown and has sparked theoretical debate. Some theorists argue that felt security is central, whereas others suggest it does not offer unique protection from death awareness, independent of self-esteem and worldview validation. We conducted two experiments to clarify felt security’s role. Testing felt security on its own, it significantly mediated the association between death awareness and increased intimacy striving (Study 1). However, when tested alongside relational self-esteem and worldview validation, felt security again exerted a significant mediating effect in parallel with relational self-esteem, although only among female participants (Study 2). These results provide initial support for the subordinate tripartite model and functional independence claim put forth in recent years. We discuss the implications of these findings.

T1  - Health Capability and Psychological Effects of Regular Exercise on Adults: Middle-Aged and Older
AN  - 2447808764
AB  - This study sought to determine whether there is any difference on participation in regular exercise between middle-aged and older adults and to determine whether the benefits of regular exercise differed between middle-aged and older adults in terms of health capability, mood, or anxiety symptoms and life-satisfaction level. The results indicated that older adults engaged in regular exercise more frequently than middle-aged adults. In addition, exercise participants among middle-aged adults had the better health capabilities, lower depression and anxiety symptoms, and higher life-satisfaction level than nonparticipants. On the other hands, older adults tended to be negatively associated with depression and anxiety symptoms and be positively correlated with life-satisfaction level than middle-aged adults even if middle-aged adults had the better health capabilities. These findings might be beneficial to provide appropriate exercise programs, to prevent and minimize the negative symptoms of anxiety and depression, and to facilitate the life-satisfaction level.

T1  - Different Forms of Biological Fatherhood and their Association with Symptoms of Psychopathology
AN  - 2447807203
AB  - While the effects of maternal psychopathology on children are well researched, few studies have addressed paternal psychopathology. We provide estimates of self-reported symptoms of psychopathology across different forms of biological fatherhood, and investigate the association between paternal psychopathology and children’s mental health. In an online survey, N = 2,590 biological fathers living in stable or blended families as well as single or separated fathers filled out the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18, Spitzer et al., 2011), indicated the presence or absence of a self-reported mental disorder, and judged their children’s mental health. Fathers living in stable families reported lower levels of psychopathological symptoms compared to single and separated fathers. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were negatively associated with fathers’ judgment of their children’s mental health. High levels of psychopathological symptoms were much more frequent than self-reported mental disorders, suggesting a need to extend the reach of mental health services.

T1  - An Association Between Perceived Social Support and Posttraumatic Stress Symptom Severity Among Women With Lifetime Sexual Victimization: The Serial Mediating Role of Resilience and Coping
AN  - 2447807148
AB  - This study examined the association between perceived social support and severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms, serially mediated by resilience and coping among women exposed to different patterns of sexual victimization experiences: childhood sexual abuse (CSA) only, adult sexual assault (ASA) only, and sexual revictimization (SR). A total of 255 sexually victimized women recruited from four U.S. universities completed self-report measures online; 112 participants reported provisionally diagnosable levels of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The proposed model was largely supported in the CSA only group and the SR group. Different patterns of mediational effects were found across the three groups. Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed.

T1  - African American Sexual Assault Survivors and Mental Health Help-Seeking: A Mixed Methods Study
AN  - 2447807046
AB  - Little research has focused on African American women’s sexual assault victimization and mental health seeking. A mixed methods study was conducted to explore African American women’s sexual assault in relationship to mental health seeking and experiences with mental health providers in a large community sample. Quantitative survey and qualitative interview data indicated unique correlates of immediate and longer term seeking of help from various mental health sources. Barriers and facilitators of African American women’s mental health seeking were identified and qualitative themes were uncovered relevant to this group of survivors. Implications for research and clinical practice with this population are provided.

T1  - Do Negative Emotional States Play a Role in the Association Between Intimate Partner Violence and Poor Health-Related Quality of Life in Chinese Women From Low-Income Families?
AN  - 2447806894
AB  - A cross-sectional analysis of a dataset of 156 participants in a health assessment program explored whether negative emotional states mediated the association between intimate partner violence (IPV) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Compared with IPV screen-negative participants, those who screened positive had significantly lower HRQoL and significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. The inverse associations between the presence of IPV and HRQoL were found to be mediated by depression, anxiety, and stress. Therefore, interventions to alleviate negative emotions in women suffering from IPV have the potential to be useful in improving their HRQoL.

T1  - Traumatic Experience, Polytraumatization, and Perinatal Depression in a Diverse Sample of Adolescent Mothers
AN  - 2436792585
AB  - This study examines the prevalence of trauma subtypes, polytraumatization, and perinatal depression (PND) in a diverse sample of adolescent mothers to help inform PND prevention, screening, and treatment efforts. We conducted a secondary analysis of a sample (N = 210) of adolescent mothers aged 14 to 20 years from a prospective longitudinal study of PND. Participants were recruited from a county-based, public health prenatal clinic, and data were collected in the prenatal and postpartum periods. In this sample, 81% of adolescent mothers reported at least one trauma experience and 75% reported lifetime experience of intimate partner violence (IPV). The most prevalent trauma types among adolescent mothers reporting PND were sexual trauma prior to age 13 (11.9%), loss of a caregiver or sibling (28.3%), emotional adversity (17.1%), and polytraumatization (43%). Trauma is alarmingly prevalent among adolescent mothers. Results suggest standards of care for adolescent mothers should include screening adolescent mothers for trauma history and provision of appropriate referrals for IPV. Findings support the need for trauma-informed treatment in perinatal public health clinics to decrease potential health risks to both mother and baby.

T1  - The Association Between Intimate Partner Violence and Signs of Depression During Pregnancy in Kilimanjaro Region, Northern Tanzania
AN  - 2436792275
AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) against pregnant women is common with severe health consequences to women and their babies. The aim of the present study is to measure the association between IPV and signs of depression among pregnant women attending antenatal care in a semi-urban setting in northern Tanzania. A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 1, 2014, to May 30, 2015, among pregnant women attending routine antenatal care in Moshi Municipality, Tanzania. During their third trimester, self-reported exposure to IPV was assessed using a validated structured questionnaire adopted from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Multi-Country Study on Women’s Health and Domestic Violence. Signs of depression were assessed using Edinburg Postpartum Depression Scale. A total of 1,116 pregnant women were included in the analysis. A total number of 433 (38.8%) reported to be exposed to at least one type of violence during their pregnancy, and 128 (11.5%) presented with signs of depression. The most common type of violence experienced was emotional violence (30.7%), followed by sexual violence (19.0%) and physical violence (10.0%). Exposure to at least one type of violence was the strongest predictor for depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [3.25, 7.86]), followed by women who reported their primary source of emotional support was individuals not related to their family as compared with support obtained from their male partner/husband (AOR = 2.25; 95% CI = [1.26, 4.02]). Positive HIV/AIDS status (AOR = 2.27; 95% CI = [1.01, 5.14]) and previous history of depression (AOR = 1.62; 95% CI = [1.00, 2.64]). After adjusting for other predictors and types of violence, physical violence was the strongest predictor for signs of depression (AOR = 4.42; 95% CI = [2.65, 7.37]). Signs of depression were commonly observed among pregnant women and strongly associated with exposure to any type of IPV. The present findings indicate an urgent need for screening depression and IPV to mitigate the adverse health outcomes related to both IPV and depression during pregnancy.

T1  - Longitudinal Effects of Gendered Harassment Perpetration and Victimization on Mental Health Outcomes in Adolescence
AN  - 2436792250
AB  - Gendered harassment, including sexual harassment and homophobic name-calling, is prevalent in adolescents and is linked to negative outcomes including depression, anxiety, suicidality, substance abuse, and personal distress. However, much of the extant literature is cross-sectional and rarely are perpetrators of these behaviors included in studies of outcomes. Therefore, the current study examined the effects of longitudinal changes in gendered harassment perpetration and victimization on changes in mental health outcomes among a large sample of early adolescents. Given that these behaviors commonly occur in the context of a patriarchal society (males hold power), we also investigated the impact of gender on gendered harassment. Participants included 3,549 students from four Midwestern middle schools (50.4% female, 49% African American, 34% White) at two time points (13 and 17 years old). Results indicated that increases from age 13 to 17 years in sexual harassment perpetration and victimization and homophobic name-calling perpetration and victimization predicted increases in depression symptoms and substance use. Gender did not moderate these pathways. These findings highlight that negative outcomes are associated with changes in gendered harassment among adolescents and emphasize the importance of prevention efforts. Implications for school interventions are discussed.

T1  - An Analysis of the Relationship Between High School Students’ Tendency Toward Violence, Self-Esteem, and Competitive Attitude
AN  - 2436792194
AB  - This study analyzes the relationship among high school students’ tendencies toward violence, self-esteem, and competitive attitudes. It was conducted in Fethiye, Muğla, between September 2013 and January 2014. The population of the study consisted of 6,531 students from 11 high schools. The participants were determined using stratified random sampling, and the study data were collected from 1,600 students. A personal information form, the Violence Tendency Scale, the Competitive Attitude Scale, and the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Scale were used as data collection tools. In this study, the rate of the participants who were exposed to violence was 15.4%. Of them, 46.2% said that one of their family members was violent toward them, while 27.3% said that their teachers had been violent toward them. Of the participants that were exposed to violence, 55.8% reported psychological violence, 27.3% reported physical violence, and 10.8% reported sexual violence. In the study, tendency toward violence is a dependent variable, while competitive attitude and self-esteem are independent variables. Family type, exposure to violence, and demographics are control variables. Age, class, school, family attitude, and exposure to violence are the variables that created significant differences in the tendency for violence. The present study showed that there was an inverse and weak yet significant relationship between the students’ tendencies toward violence and competitiveness (r = −.169), and a positive and weak relationship between tendency toward violence and self-esteem (r = .238). Also, there was an inverse and low-level significant relationship between competitiveness and self-esteem (r = −.121). The variables which affect the tendency toward violence are gender, exposure to violence, competitiveness, age, self-esteem, and extended family type in a descending order regarding their importance. The predictive power of the variables on the tendency toward violence was 16.8%, which is not statistically significant.

AB  - The purpose of the current report was to examine prior history of exposure to interpersonal violence (IPV), as compared with prior accident or prior disaster exposure, experiences during and after a disaster, and demographic variables as predictors of past month posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression severity among adolescents exposed to the tornadoes in Alabama and Missouri. IPV exposure has been consistently identified as a unique category of potentially traumatic events (PTE) that significantly increases risk for development of PTSD and other difficulties relative to other event types among adolescents. A population-based sample of adolescents and caregivers (N = 2,000) were recruited randomly from tornado-affected communities in Alabama and Joplin, Missouri. Participants completed structured telephone interviews on an average of 8.8 months posttornado. Prior history of IPV was prevalent (36.5%), as was reported history of accidents (25.9%) and prior disaster exposure (26.9%). Negative binomial regression analyses with PTSD and depression symptom counts for past month as outcome variables indicated that history of predisaster IPV was most robustly related to PTSD and depression symptoms, such that those with a history of IPV endorsed over 3 times the number of symptoms than those without IPV history. Final model statistics indicated that female gender, physical injury to caregiver, concern about others’ safety, prior disaster, prior accident, and prior IPV exposure were also related to PTSD. Predictors of depression symptoms were similar with the exception that concern about others’ safety was not a predictor and age was a predictor in the final model. It is important to evaluate potential additive effects of IPV history in addition to recent disaster exposure variables and to consider such history when developing interventions aimed to reduce or prevent symptoms of PTSD and depression among adolescents recently exposed to disaster.

T1  - Childhood Trauma, Trait Anxiety, and Anxious Attachment as Predictors of Intimate Partner Violence in College Students
AN  - 2436792107
AB  - The current study investigates the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV), childhood trauma, trait anxiety, depression, and anxious attachment in college students. Ninety-three male and 161 female undergraduate students at Fairfield University, ranging in age from 17 to 23, with a mean age of 18.8 years, participated. Participants completed five self-report inventories: The Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationships Inventory (CADRI), the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Adult Attachment Scale (AAS). IPV perpetration in college dating relationships was related to childhood emotional and physical abuse, emotional and physical neglect, and trait anxiety. IPV victimization in college dating relationships was related to childhood emotional and physical abuse, childhood emotional and physical neglect, and an anxious attachment style. IPV perpetration and victimization were also significantly correlated with one another. Subscale analyses suggest that childhood emotional abuse was related to being both the perpetrator and victim of verbal or emotional abuse in dating relationships. Childhood physical abuse, physical neglect, and emotional abuse were related to both perpetration and victimization of physical IPV. Threatening behavior perpetration in dating relationships was related to childhood emotional abuse, emotional neglect, physical abuse, and physical neglect; however, being the victim of threatening behavior was only related to childhood emotional abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect, not childhood physical abuse. These results support the relationship between childhood trauma and dating violence in college students. They also support a role for anxiety in IPV, although trait anxiety was related to perpetration and an anxious attachment style was correlated with IPV victimization. In addition, they suggest that different experiences of childhood trauma may relate to different aspects of IPV in college dating relationships.
